different types of information systems play in supporting the decision-making processes of the different levels of organizational
management.

Students will also become familiar with anthropology’s historical trajectory and development, and its major theoretical movements and interventions. Ultimately, students will not only be able to appreciate the diversity of human cultures, but also be able to turn the anthropological lens on their own lives and communities.",4.00,LEC,16W,S2,70,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,All undergraduate students,"Esler,Dominic William","Phase 2: open for MGSHSS and SAHSOL (Law School) freshmen and sophomore students

ANTH&SOC,ANTH,244,Political Anthropology,"This survey course is an introduction to the broad subfield of political anthropology. What counts as political across different cultures and societies? How do relations of power come to be, and how does their organization, distribution, and appearance vary across time and space? Taking politics as an object of anthropological analysis, this class will explore how it relates to other aspects of society, such as family, religion, or economics. To organize our exploration of this subfield, we will use violence and power as twin lenses through which to view the realm of the political. Throughout the semester, we will ask what anthropology offers to help us understand the horror of political violence, and what we can glean about the nature of the political from the ethnographic realities of anger, joy, devastation, and hope. Drawing on a non-exhaustive range of ethnographic, philosophical, and multimedia sources from across the world, this course will equip students to think about power, politics, and the contemporary global condition using everyday perspectives and ordinary lives.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,40,0,Yes,No,2,100,Take Home,Not Allowed,"Asif,Ghazal","Phase 2: open for First-year, sophomore and junior students in MGSHSS and SAHSOL

ANTH&SOC,ANTH,253,Women's Lives Across Cultures,"This course focuses on contemporary women’s lives in different economic and cultural settings. It examines their common
experiences and some of the global processes which link them. The assigned readings and films this term deal with women living in
the Sudan, Mali, Nicaragua, the U.S., China, India, France, Thailand, Papa New Guinea, Afghanistan, Korea, Lebanon and Japan, as
well as women who are displaced around the world.
During the term we will examine some of the typical roles women play in society; the cultural rationales and structural conditions
behind practices like female circumcision and women’s acceptance of and resistance to such practices; the globalization of work,
sex, and ideas of female beauty; the influence different forms of social organization have on women’s lives; media images of
women; and women’s social activism and development work on behalf of women. We will also spend a significant portion of the
course critically deconstructing powder dynamics within the feminist movement, examining the impacts of western and neoliberal
feminisms, as well as the significant contributions of black, postcolonial, and indigenous feminists towards gender, sexuality, and
race-based rights.
As anthropologists we will be striving to acquire an insider’s perspective, but we will also examine the opinions of outsiders who
typically view other women’s lives through the filter of their own culture. We will be reading about and watching films which show
both women’s victimization as well as their agency and collective efforts to create better lives for themselves and for their societies
and future generations.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,35,0,Yes,No,2,100,No,Not Allowed,Rabia  Kamal,"Phase 2: Open for First-year, sophomore and junior students in MGSHSS and SAHSOL

ANTH&SOC,ANTH,266,Kinship: Making Sense of Human Relations,"Before we know of anything we know that we belong to a family or caste, clan, tribe etc., and we know about our relatives, and this knowledge seems so much self-evident that we may ask what else we could know about kinship. We are so often convinced that the notion of the family is universal, natural, linked to blood relations, that a child needs mother and father, and that our siblings are those who are born of our parents, as well as that we may marry our cousins. This course will question the universality of all such concepts and will explain how they are relativized by different ethnographic data, leading to alternative views and perspectives.
The course will concentrate on the foundational aspects of the debate on understanding kinship: we will explore the different perspectives on kinship which include the beginnings of anthropology itself. It is structured in four main parts: it links kinship to nature and culture, locates its meaning within the structuralist
perspective, and in the end focuses on its intrinsic connection to gender. The literature takes us to different regions of the world, like Africa, South Asia, the USA, and Melanesia.
The debate on kinship was long regarded as a core of the anthropological discipline, before many other interests opened up and widened and diversified the discipline. However, it is still important, and the fundamental platform for accessing any society as a whole, as it provides essential clues for an understanding of the human subject as well as social and cultural organization. Kinship also crucially interacts with other topics, like, ritual, gender, economics, politics, or religion. Furthermore, it is the only branch of cultural anthropology which is not shared with any other discipline.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,50,0,Yes,No,2,100,Outside Exam Week,All undergraduate students,"Alvi,Syeedda Anjum Ara","Phase 2: First-year, sophomore and junior students in MGSHSS and SAHSOL can enroll.

ANTH&SOC,ANTH,287,The Indian Ocean,"Imagine a map scaled not by abstract distance between two cities, but by the time it took for people to move between those places before the advent of air travel. In such a map, the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean shrinks into a small lake, around which a majority of the world’s urban population has historically lived. Despite living in close proximity, the entangled histories of societies around the Indian Ocean are usually compartmentalized into different nations. A growing set of literature on the Indian Ocean has begun connecting these places through larger structural systems of trade, empires, and religion. In this class, however, we will approach the Indian Ocean through the microhistories of those who lived in this interconnected space. We will ask: how did people experience life in the multi-ethnic and politically divided, yet interdependent world of the Indian Ocean? What brought people together, and what kept them apart? 

In this class we will read grounded accounts of life around the ocean: primary documents such as diaries, letters, manuscripts, and travelogues, microhistories, historical fiction, and ethnographies. Through an assortment of narrative-driven and detail-rich sources, we will develop a diverse set of characters, inextricably tied to the Indian Ocean through social, religious, economic, and political networks. The course is chronologically divided into four different sections, namely, early modern, the long 19th century, the short 20th century, and the global 21st century. Instead of assuming a drastic break when moving from one period to another, we will be thinking about what change looks like when seen through the eyes of our characters on the ground.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,15,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,Not Allowed,"Lutfi,Ameem","Phase 2: Open for First-year, sophomore and junior students in MGSHSS and SAHSOL

ANTH&SOC,ANTH,310,Classical Anthropological Theory,"The field of cultural anthropology is an inquiry into the conditions which render us human. This involves a scientific understanding of the concept of culture. We find ourselves at the same time different from and also similar to people living at other places in the world. In order to capture this human diversity and unity in an analytical description different authors start from different premises which constitute the classical theoretical paradigms defining to a large degree the discipline of cultural anthropology. They present, however, for many beginners and those who like to find a way into the discipline, a confusing field whose borders appear to be not properly defined. For an intellectual orientation, a comparative knowledge of its theoretical positions is essential: which perspectives do they take, which topics do they emphasize, on which basic assumptions do they rest? The course provides an initial overview over the most important theories for a basic orientation by looking at theoretical approaches from the 19th century up to the beginnings of the 21st one. This includes evolutionism, functionalism, structuralism, and newer approaches which are elucidated with examples of the most prominent authors in the field, and evaluated in relation to each other",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,40,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,All undergraduate students,Lukas Albert  Paul Werth,"Phase 2: open for Sophomores, juniors and seniors MGSHSS and SAHSOL

ANTH&SOC,ANTH,320,Qualitative Research Methods,"Qualitative research has an extensive and prominent history in the social sciences. From the research of the “Chicago school” in the 1920s and 1930s to the more recent “critical ethnography,” qualitative research methods provide essential tools to study the social world. 

Throughout the course we will discuss and explore the ways social scientists employ qualitative research to identify, document and critically analyse complex social phenomena and patterns and practices of interaction, as well as track and analyze their changes over time. Fieldwork allows social scientists to examine the symbolic, religious, gendered, socio-economic, political and historical forces and contexts that underlie and motivate beliefs, ideologies, practices and change. 
The course deals first of all with the development of fieldwork as a defining feature of anthropology as a discipline. It then goes on to discuss research design and the major methods of gathering field information in anthropology. These include the process of gaining access to a field site, participant observation, the unstructured interview and life histories. Dilemmas of reflexivity and voice, approaches to the analysis of qualitative evidence, oral and written presentation of, and evaluation and dissemination of qualitative research will be examined. How to keep detailed field notes and a discussion of ethics arising from fieldwork will also be covered, as well as some techniques of data analysis and some observations about the writing-up process. 
Emphasis will be placed on equipping students to gain the practical skills necessary to conduct a small fieldwork project using theoretically-informed, collaborative, action-oriented and ethical methods. Course readings will be drawn from socio-cultural anthropology and its related disciplines.
Students will be expected to do a group project involving fieldwork. Each group will consist of 4-5 members. These field projects will be the culmination of what has been taught throughout the course. This will then be presented to the entire class at the end of the course so that students are best able to learn from each others’ varying experiences. 
In addition to academic research qualitative research methods can be applied to social marketing, program design and policy formation, and also be used to monitor and evaluate changes over time. Participatory and ‘applied’ qualitative methods permit researchers in a wide variety of disciplinary, institutional and organizational settings to address power differentials as they occur in the process of investigation or inform social and political change",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,40,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,Not Allowed,"Asif,Ghazal","phase 2: open for MGSHSS and SAHSOL sophomore, junior and senior

ANTH&SOC,ANTH,353,Gender and Urban Screen Narratives,"Films, television shows, and other screen texts, capture constant changes in motion and play a vital role in the perception and interpretation of the evolving world around us. In this course, we closely examine a variety of screen texts to understand and breakdown the representation of gender and the role of the city as seen in popular culture and created through independent processes. We begin with an examination of early screen texts and a discussion on gender and urban development to lay a foundation for the analysis of modern-day conversations between gender and the city. Here we examine the portrayal of women and their interaction both with and within the city. As we continue our analysis, we look at how the portrayal of men has changed and explore the idea of the growing crisis of masculinity in the urban setting. At the same time, we acknowledge non-binary expressions of gender identities, the evolution of technology and digital formats and the physical and emotional anxieties apparent in urban spaces through migration and movement. By taking examples of historical and current gender and urban narratives from across the world, this course encourages students to critically engage with the ever-changing local and global perspectives of gender and the city on screen and imagine what future narratives may hold.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,10,0,Yes,No,2,100,No,All undergraduate students,"Hamid,Zebunnisa","Phase 2: open for Sophomores, juniors and seniors MGSHSS and SAHSOL

ANTH&SOC,ANTH,355,"Folklore Futures: Negotiating, Reclaiming, and Reimagining Indigeneity through Storytelling","One of the most common refrains heard for many of today’s social and cultural shifts is that Pakistan is beleaguered by ‘Western’

and ‘Foreign’ influence. The idea that progress is an exclusively ‘western’ notion is a deeply entrenched view that needs to be

challenged. Pakistan’s folk traditions – whether Punjabi, Sindhi, Baloch, Pashtun or others, include many deeply rebellious, spiritual,

and progressive messages that have seldom been framed or communicated to young people in contemporary contexts and settings.

This includes everything from the qissas of Hir, Sohni, Sassi, and Sahiban to Punjabi female dance forms of Gidda Boliyan and

Tappay, to Sindhi Sufi shrine cultures and Pashtun fabrics and embroidery. Many are unaware of the immense repository of stories

that already exist in the centuries-long history of the indigenous land that is present day Pakistan.

This course is an attempt to repurpose many Indigenous research and decolonizing methodologies with regards to introducing young

people to folklore, folk art, and what being part of ‘folk’ means. Most folklore around the world draws from women’s knowledge,

story- telling, and craft traditions and the bulk of the contemporary readings in this course approach indigeneity and folklore from an

explicitly feminist and queer lens.

The proposed course aims to help students understand and develop links with indigenous cultures and traditions from the

subcontinent. Various elements of indigenous culture are explored within the course through in-class performances i.e., oral

storytelling, music, dance, craft, fabric, and language etc. The course is structured primarily as an exploratory grassroots exercise

where students will be asked to find contemporary ways of connecting with and exploring their own indigenous cultures, from

objects and stories that have been present in their family for generations. Students will be encouraged to centralize themselves in the

act of storytelling and how they choose to express it, i.e. as a qissa performance, a dance performance, musical performance,

documentary project or other mediums that will allow them to trace and incorporate family, tribal, or provincial local legends and

folklore in their projects. Several guest speakers will assist the students in utilizing performance, musical and theatrical tools to

explore both old and new forms of indigenous story telling. Student’s will also work on indigenous feminist traditions from a variety

of cultures that incorporate a blend of methodologies, theory, and praxis, towards helping them develop a contemporary

understanding of folklore so they may access it for their own purposes. Students will also be encouraged to develop and explore their

own folklore traditions by unpacking existing folklore in various sociopolitical and gendered contexts with the aim of incorporating

it in contemporary settings through a variety of mediums such as film, theatre and/or craft. Students will be expected to engage on a

personal level with the subject matter and write about their experiences in tracing lineages, family trees, local, ethnic, and family

lore, and other aspects of indigeneity through in-class performances, written assignments, storytelling, field journals, or other platforms. The course will help students to use myth, folklore, and indigeneity to explore both historical and contemporary questions of gender, identity, and culture by also providing them with the theoretical and performance tools required to navigate these vast domains for themselves in new and exciting ways.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,11,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,All undergraduate students,"Amir,Maria","Phase 1: Open for Juniors and seniors of MGSHSS (except Econ).

ANTH&SOC,ANTH,363,Muslim Veiling: The Struggle for Identities in Diasporas,"The course will mainly concentrate on the conditions, conflicts, and identity of Muslims in diaspora by, first, briefly introducing religious, historical, and ethnographical views of Muslim veiling, and then discussing how foreign laws handle Muslim identities. Finally, it discusses feminist perspectives and the divide between secularism and the perspective of the religion. Most of the references included here discuss contemporary debates and case-studies.
The Muslim veiling which existed before Islam and which we observe since generations and for which we hold obvious explanations, and which influences our lives, has created conflict when coming in touch with other cultural values which lead to anthropological, sociological, political, and philosophical discussions, resulting in a vast number of books and articles from all over the world.

Muslim veiling is a complex phenomenon interpreted from different perspectives emphasizing religious or cultural variation, pragmatic, economic and political aspects. Mass media regard it either as a suppression of passive women or as an active agent of self-construction of politically active women. It is at odds with the constitutions of many countries, leading to the formation or suggestion of laws to deal with Muslim minorities in Europe and other Western countries. Is it really a hindrance for a woman who accepts it as a will of God, is it imposed by the male gender to control female sexuality, or is it taken by a woman on her own will without coercion? Further, is it only for the female gender, is it to be understood only in terms of modesty, is it only a matter of dress? These and other questions will be examined in the course.
The above questions involve discussions about Habermas’s notion of Public Sphere, the role of political philosophy and of the political history of different countries, laws concerning neutrality, discrimination, and religious freedom.

BIOLOGY,BIO,314,Virology and Microbiology,"The goal of this course is to provide a strong foundation for advanced microbiology course by familiarizing students with knowledge of bacteriology and virology.  Microbiology is an exciting discipline with far-reaching impacts in human health and disease.  This course will focus on the study of microbes in particular bacteria and viruses and their interrelationship with human disease.  Understanding these relationships is essential in order to develop interventions to prevent infections in a community.  The first quarter of the course will cover the basic principles of bacteriology including bacterial structure, growth, metabolism, genetics and general concepts of bacterial disease mechanisms.  In the second quarter we will draw on the basic principles learned in the first quarter of the semester to understand bacteriology as it relates to human health and human disease.  More precisely, the course will cover mechanism of disease and drug resistance and State-of-the-art technologies developed to understand pathogenesis.  The next half of the course focus will be on viruses, another important pathogen that causes significant burden of disease every year.  Globally viral infections kill approximately 2 million individuals every year.  The higher burden of infections and fatalities caused by viruses are the result of their intrinsic diversity, which makes it difficult to treat and prevent viral infections.  This part of the course will follow the same design as the part on bacteriology. However, in the next half the course will be focused on basic understanding of viral structures, assembly, replication, types of viruses, viral pathogenesis and finally vaccines.

It is designed to engage thought, intuition, imagination, experimentation, and execution together like it is brought together in the classrooms of the best universities in the World. 

Description: 

This course employs both non-game, real life, and game, virtual ways to help students learn policy design and delivery. The field of policy design is full of promise for the North and the South. Each course topic, which is designed around a worth-asking question(s), starts with the regular, mainstream scholarship for an hour and brings in insights from the emerging design instrument of gamification with real examples from Pakistan and elsewhere. The very purpose of this strategy is to equip ourselves with non-game and game approaches to policy design- both of them are being sought after by employers. 

The course aims to help us develop skills in imagination, thinking, reasoning, and doing. It will prepare us for solving problems in government, business, and government-business intersections. It will contribute to prepare us for three roles: jobs in government, jobs in business and nonprofit sector, and, consultancies. The playful, activity-based, experiential pedagogy of the course will help us learn to imagine, think, and do activities of problem-solving and implementing solutions independently.

HSS,CLCS,1122,The Art of Reading and Writing Urdu,"Urdu as a language has produced masterpieces in literary texts and also possesses the capacity to express and discuss higher academic and philosophical problems and concerns. The material that exists in the Urdu language in terms of its poetry, fiction: novel – short story, drama and critical and academic writings would validate this statement. However, many are not aware of this fact, especially students educated in modern school systems in Pakistan where Urdu is taught as a second language. A large segment of students in LUMS comes from this background. On the other hand, the public sector universities which possess established Urdu language departments have not yet been able to produce or prepare students, well equipped with modern tools and methods to explore and study literary tests of Urdu that could establish their literary and academic authenticity in the modern world academia.
Keeping this situation in view this course is designed to enhance the reading and writing skills of students who have a background of studying Urdu as a second language in schools, more commonly known as schools where the medium of instruction is English or those geared towards O and A level or IB programs.
To this end, the main emphasis would be on selected Urdu texts - journalistic, literary and academic- the close reading of which, with the help of modern hermeneutic tools, will bring students closer to the genius and delicacy of the Urdu language and its literature. Along with textual study, students will learn the basics of Urdu grammar, idioms, proverbs and phrases. This will extend their pool of Urdu vocabulary and develop their skills to appreciate any kind of Urdu text. 
Students would be enrolled through a selection process and only students with a weak background in Urdu would be enrolled in this course",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,20,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,Not Allowed,"Hussain,Zahid","Enrollment with instructor’s consent only, through force enrollment."
HSS,CLCS,1212,Elements of a Screenplay,"This course is for film lovers and filmmakers alike, as it focuses on discovering the many components of the document that serves as the blueprint for all your favorite films: the screenplay. Through careful study of screenplays and films, both short and feature length, live action and animation, students will learn to discern what great screenplays are made of by exploring screenplay elements such as plot, three act structure, experimental/non-linear narratives, script formatting, hero’s journey, genre conventions, character arcs as well as techniques for building effective drama, conflict, stakes, pacing, dialogue, scene and sequence design etc.

What makes a compelling cinematic story, and what keeps us glued to the screen? How do films manipulate, grab and hold our attention, and how much of its credit goes to the screenplay? To find out the answers we’ll turn to the masters of world cinema, watching movies in many languages by filmmakers such as Asghar Farhadi, Lee Chang Dong, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Ritesh Batra, Ryusuke Hamaguchi, Denis Villeneuve, Bong Joon Ho, Coen Brothers, Ruben Ostlund etc. To inform our reading of these film’s screenplays and stories, we’ll read, watch and discuss craft essays and masterclasses by screenwriting teachers and playwrights such as David Mamet, Aaron Sorkin, Charlie Kaufman, Paul Schrader, Blake Snyder, John Truby, Syd Field and Robert Mckee. Their teachings will be used as framing lenses for our analysis of the screenplays and films we shall study in this class.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,70,0,Yes,No,2,100,Take Home,All undergraduate students,"Lali,Usama Mumtaz","Phase 2: open for MGSHSS and SAHSOL (Law School) freshmen and sophomore students.

HSS,CLCS,2116,Shahnameh: The Story of Our World,"Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh or the “Book of Kings” is an eleventh-century epic poem composed in Persian,
distinguished by perennial poise and majestic style. It tells the tales of kings, fighters, and noble men of bygone Persian empires, thus positing itself as both a history and a series of stories. The poem—considered the longest epic ever written—is venerated across the Persian-speaking world and beyond, where it has been ceremonially
read, memorized, performed and painted for many centuries now. This course, through a selection of stories from this great epic, intends to revive some of the immortal characters and events of Shahnameh in our collective consciousness and hopes to read its stories for their relevance to our times. Along with the textual close reading and deciphering the symbols embedded in Shahnameh’s poetic imagery, the course will also trace the wide range depiction of Shahnameh in the miniature art produced in Iran and the broader Indo-Persian world. The course will also pay a close attention to Shahnameh’s appreciation in the West and its deep influence on South Asian literatures.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,50,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,All undergraduate students,"Fayyaz,Fatima","phase 2: open for First-year, sophomore and junior students in MGSHSS and SAHSOL

Starting with an analysis of the evolution of 21st Century broadcasting (Both local and International) - the course focuses on the creative forms and business of contemporary serialized content, notably high-end drama, new comedy and documentary for platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Apple TV and YouTube along with local streaming platforms like Tapmad, See Prime, Pikture TV, etc. Specifically, this course will be an exploration of the stories and forms that are part of what is being called the new “Golden Age” of television worldwide. What kind of ideas and genres are most effective? How is a story or set of characters developed over individual episodes into a compelling whole? Through seminars, workshops, industry guests, case studies and industry research, students will be given a context through which they will create and produce their own drama or comedy web series, using the conventions of television including the writer’s room and creative chief – the showrunner. They will also learn how television production works and how to direct continuing characters and film within a tight schedule using two cameras, standing sets and the economies of recurring elements. By the end of this course students would have collaborated on the production of a television drama or comedy series and critically evaluated that process and product. This whole process will allow them to demonstrate an understanding of the roles and responsibilities required within television creative teams.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,30,0,Yes,No,2,100,No,All undergraduate students,"Tabish Habib,Raja Mohammad","Enrollment with instructor’s consent only, through force enrollments

HSS,CLCS,2310,Fiction Writing Workshop,"“I’m looking for fiction that resembles the Thirty-Mile Woman from Toni Morrison’s Beloved: ‘She is a friend of my mind. She gather me, man. The pieces I am, she gather them and give them back to me in all the right order.’ I’m looking for fiction in which a heart struggles against itself, in which the messy unmanageable complexity of the world is revealed. Sentences that are so sharp they cut the eye.”—Junot Díaz This is the first of two writing workshops aimed at introducing students to fiction writing. We shall proceed from writing exercises designed to make students aware of specific elements in fiction (character, setting, voice, etc.) to producing full-length stories. The workshop will be in two parts: a. the writing exercises; and, b. writing full-length fiction. The main component, however, is the writing. We shall work as a group to critique fiction submitted by our peers and thereby try to develop a critical sense of what works in specific stories and what doesn’t—and most importantly, why, in each case, and how the weaknesses could be addressed. We will also spend considerable time editing and revising, which are integral to the writing process",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,15,0,Yes,No,2,100,No,Not Allowed,Bilal  Tanweer,"Enrollment with instructor's consent only,.through force enrollments"
HSS,CLCS,3124,Post-Colonial Thought in Urdu Literature,"Postcolonial theory aims to revisiting, reinterpreting and in most cases deconstructing and busting the myths about people, history, culture, languages, literature, arts etc. of colonized lands created by colonial masters during their rule as an essential part of the strategy to guard their precarious colonial hegemonic position, through thoroughly wrought out project of reform, development and enlightenment, disseminated by means of controlled press, new historiography, education system, legislation and construction of new identities and uncritically swallowed or resisted or consciously taken as the sole way of redemption by colonized people. Though in Urdu this theory was introduced just few years ago, it has spawned some enlightening works that seem to offer new yet convincing and decolonized image of literature produced during colonial and postcolonial eras. While having a cursory look at the trajectory of modern Urdu literature, we come across the fact that it has gone through many phases: it originates in late 19th century as part of grand project of reform, civilizing and enlightenment initiated by the British; earlier examples of modern-colonial Urdu literature have moral and national ethos contributing to construction of Muslim selfhood; in early 20th century we find themes of resistance against colonialism and European cavillation alike with strengthening monolith notion of Muslim selfhood. Partition causes displacement, migration, homelessness on one hand and tearing away cultural bonds between religiously-defined nation states once and for all. In postcolonial era monolithic notion of Muslim selfhood starts to be turning into fragmented one. A sort of clash of national narratives can be traced in Urdu literature written after partition. Fall of Dhaka testifies the fact. Nostalgia of abandoned places and reclamation of lost cultural artifacts become major themes of postcolonial modern Urdu literature. This course is designed to make students cognizant of and enabling them to see critically the developing phases of colonial and postcolonial Urdu literature.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,40,0,Yes,No,2,100,Take Home,Not Allowed,"Abbas,Nasir","Phase 2: Open for sophomores, juniors and seniors MGSHSS and SAHSOL

HSS,CLCS,3125,Marsiya: Anis and Dabir,"Marsiya is an elegiac poem to commemorate the martyrdom and valor of Hussain ibn-e Ali and his companions in the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE. Covering a wide range of emotional registers, the marsiya emerged as a distinctive genre of poetic expression in the nineteenth-century North India. What makes it unique is its fusion of epic and tragic narrative rendered as elegy. It became a powerful medium of artistic recitals and performing arts in India for its capacity to fuse together the intellectual, cultural, and devotional registers in the same verse.
Although marsiya can be traced back to its origins in Arabic and Persian literatures, it enjoyed an unparalleled literary prime and popularity in Urdu literature through the works of its two prime nineteenth-century exponents: Mir Babar Ali Anis (1802-1874) and Mirza Salamat Ali Dabir (1803-1875).
This course includes the study of the poetics of marsiya, its development in Urdu, and a survey of some of the major exponents of the marsiya. In addition, it focuses on the life and works of Anis and Dabir and their defining contributions in the development of this genre.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,40,0,Yes,No,2,100,Take Home,Not Allowed,"Nizami,Ghulam Moeenuddin","Phase 2: Open for Sophomores, juniors and seniors MGSHSS and SAHSOL

HSS,CLCS,3212,The Chromatic Lens: The Evolution of Colour from Film to Digital,"This course aims to engage students by examining the history and evolution of colour in Cinema as it moves from the medium of film to digital. Cinema was born in black-and-white, and this compelled early filmmakers to develop a mastery of light and dark. In 1914, Technicolor began experimenting with various film stock to produce colour but it wasn’t until 1932 that they mastered the dye-transfer methods in a three-colour film to create the most vibrant colours cinema has ever seen. Since then, cinema has evolved to modern day digital colour grading which has allowed filmmakers to bring out their intended mood, atmosphere, and emotion, along with creating an overall cohesive colour scheme to bring their visions to life. Through practical exercises, readings, film screenings, essays and a final project, students will study the evolution of colour in cinema, understanding it’s usage and significance for storytelling as well as it’s practical application in the modern day digital industry.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,40,0,Yes,No,2,100,No,Not Allowed,"Tabish Habib,Raja Mohammad","Phase 2: Open for MGSHSS and SAHSOL sophomores, juniors and seniors

HSS,CLCS,3215,Gender and Urban Screen Narratives,"Films, television shows, and other screen texts, capture constant changes in motion and play a vital role in the perception and interpretation of the evolving world around us. In this course, we closely examine a variety of screen texts to understand and breakdown the representation of gender and the role of the city as seen in popular culture and created through independent processes. We begin with an examination of early screen texts and a discussion on gender and urban development to lay a foundation for the analysis of modern-day conversations between gender and the city. Here we examine the portrayal of women and their interaction both with and within the city. As we continue our analysis, we look at how the portrayal of men has changed and explore the idea of the growing crisis of masculinity in the urban setting. At the same time, we acknowledge non-binary expressions of gender identities, the evolution of technology and digital formats and the physical and emotional anxieties apparent in urban spaces through migration and movement. By taking examples of historical and current gender and urban narratives from across the world, this course encourages students to critically engage with the ever-changing local and global perspectives of gender and the city on screen and imagine what future narratives may hold.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,20,0,Yes,No,2,100,No,All undergraduate students,"Hamid,Zebunnisa","Phase 2: open for Sophomores, juniors and seniors MGSHSS and SAHSOL

HSS,CLCS,4113,Orientalism,"Edward Said’s magisterial Orientalism (1978) altered, perhaps irrevocably, the cultural implications and literal bearings of a term that for almost two centuries prior designated the meticulous scholarly study of territories that lay to the east of Europe. Comprehensive and ambitious, the systematic attempt to understand the Orient was essentially a philological one, but that on account of the scope afforded by the latter category came to encompass a much broader domain. In this course, we will try to trace the transformation of a discipline whose initial emergence is tied to the moment of the European Enlightenment, and that takes on new dimensions with the rise of the imperial endeavor. We can also imagine this transformation as mediated by Europe’s varied commercial and colonial interests in two separate “Orients,” Islamicate and Indic. Over the course of the semester, we will grapple with precisely these issues: how and why does Europe choose to imagine the Islamic East in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries through the modes that it does? What happens to this category of an Islamic East in the European narrative when faced with the question of a classical Indic Orient? With the consolidation of an imperial presence in India, how do the cultural implements of Orientalism actually alter and reconfigure certain “pre-colonial” modes? Our primary texts range from the “literary” or fictional to the scientific, illustrating the breadth of the discipline and the trajectories of its influence from the metropolis to the late colonial formation.",4.00,SEM,16W,M1,15,0,Yes,No,1,200,No,Not Allowed,"Wasif Khan,Maryam","Phase 2: open for All MGSHSS junior and senior

Both descriptive and inferential statistics are covered. We first review techniques for organizing and presenting the raw data and elementary probability theory. Next, we discuss various techniques to make inferences. Along with probability theory, sampling distribution and central limit theorem shall be discussed. The idea of central limit theorem will naturally lead towards the confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for mean and proportion. We follow this discussion with single and multiple regression analysis, model building, design of experiments and categorical data analysis. The course also aims to give a hands-on experience with using a statistical package R for carrying out data analysis. The main objective of the course is to provide students with the foundations of statistical inference mostly used in business and economics.",3.00,LEC,16W,S1,60,5,Yes,No,2,75,Yes,Not Allowed,Muhammad  Asim,"Enrollment Phase 1: SDSB Soph, Junior, Senior

BUSADM,DISC,327,Risk Management Process,"Risk management helps identify and analyze potential issues that could arise during a project or process. Risk analysis is used to reduce the impact of a negative event, compare benefits to risks, plan responses to address emergencies or other adverse events and mitigate or eliminate risks during a process. 
This course constitutes a study of risk assessment and management techniques, methods, and models used in the industry to minimize, control, and communicate risks, including conducting various risk management protocols. The students will learn practical applications of risk-based planning and risk management tools essential to the success of any program. They will also grasp the principles to communicate the process and its value in avoiding catastrophic outcomes. We’ll rely on simulations and case studies to deliver key concepts. 
“The recommended textbook takes a close look at misused and misapplied basic analysis methods and shows how some of the most popular risk management methods are no better than astrology! Using examples from the 2008 credit crisis, natural disasters, outsourcing to China, engineering disasters, and more, Hubbard reveals critical flaws in risk management methods; and shows how all these problems can be fixed. The solutions involve combinations of scientifically proven and frequently used methods from nuclear power, exploratory oil, and other areas of business and government. Finally, Hubbard explains how new forms of collaboration across all industries and government can improve risk management in every field.”",3.00,LEC,16W,S1,60,0,Yes,No,2,75,Yes,Not Allowed,"Khan,Ahmed Majeed","Enrollment Categories

ACF,DISC,420,Business Analytics,"Throughout the Management Science degree, students have already been exposed to a number of statistical and analytical techniques such as decision analysis, regression, optimization, etc. However, before these can be practically deployed as “business analytics” or “business intelligence” (i.e. analytical tools and techniques that rely on a business‘ data to solve business problems) three things remain. These three things, described as follows, are the focus of this course: 1. Understanding the systems and their organization to support business analytics: Why use a data warehouse on top of a regular database? What components and processes have todays organizations developed to practically deal with capture and dissemination of business intelligence? (The top left circle in the diagram above) 2. Data mining techniques: Certain analytical techniques rely on computerized “machine learning”. There are supervised versus unsupervised learning and classification versus association. This course will approach the subject from a business perspective: what is the objective of the technique? What business problems can it resolve? And mostly hands-on application of the tools. (the overlap between information systems circle and statistics circle) 3. Integration of business analytics topics: No real-world problem comes with a label such as “Use regression or the a priori algorithm.” After studying data-mining techniques, the student should now have a full menu of approaches at their disposal. It is the intelligence of the business professional that guides them in choosing which technique to employ. Hence, this course aims to help students practice this judgment call at a basic level in various situations essentially using a case-based approach.",3.00,LEC,16W,S1,60,5,Yes,No,2,75,Yes,Not Allowed,Maheen  Aamir Syed,"Enrollment Phase1: MGS Senior

ECON,ECON,121,Principles of Macroeconomics,"""Overall Theme  To provide the students with an introduction to the basic macroeconomic principles; to enable students to appreciate the workings of real (labour and goods) and asset/money markets and the nature of equilibrium in each market; to emphasize the role of macroeconomic policies that affect internal and external deficits, inflation and growth of per capita income. Throughout the course a focus will be on ‘critical thinking’ to analyze macroeconomic problems.   
Focus areas The major areas of focus will be the inputs market, goods market, money/asset market, and economic growth.  Business cycles will also be discussed and linked to macroeconomic policy debate issues of ‘active’ versus ‘passive’ and ‘rules’ versus discretion.  The equilibrium IS-LM, ADAS model will be covered with some basic applications, providing a smooth transition to Intermediate Macroeconomics.   
The course is pitched at the core principles level so is based on the understanding that students have at least attained the some basic macroeconomics knowledge equivalent to that covered in any primary Economics course.    
Upon completion of the course it is expected that students should be able to:  
(a) understand the structure of the economy and theories of macroeconomics at a level appropriate for a first year economics graduate; (b) understand the key links between the goods market, input markets and money markets.   (c) understand the macroeconomic models underlying the goods, input and money market, as well as the IS-LM, AD-AS framework

Focus areas The major areas of focus will be the inputs market, goods market, money/asset market, and economic growth.  Business cycles will also be discussed and linked to macroeconomic policy debate issues of ‘active’ versus ‘passive’ and ‘rules’ versus discretion.  The equilibrium IS-LM, ADAS model will be covered with some basic applications, providing a smooth transition to Intermediate Macroeconomics.   
The course is pitched at the core principles level so is based on the understanding that students have at least attained the some basic macroeconomics knowledge equivalent to that covered in any primary Economics course.    
Upon completion of the course it is expected that students should be able to:  
(a) understand the structure of the economy and theories of macroeconomics at a level appropriate for a first year economics graduate; (b) understand the key links between the goods market, input markets and money markets.   (c) understand the macroeconomic models underlying the goods, input and money market, as well as the IS-LM, AD-AS framework

Educational institutions, especially schools are an integral part of the socialization process, preparing the next generation to take on their role as “social” actors. The course examines how and why the education system perpetuates or challenges existing inequalities within society. It introduces students to sociological theories of education, examining the intersection between education, class, culture, gender, resistance and democracy. The first part provides a macro level analysis of education and its place within society by introducing students to grand theories of education with a particular emphasis on functionalism, pragmatism, and critical pedagogy. The second part focuses on the formalized education system, in particular the school, examining the structure and organization of the school, teaching and pedagogy, classroom inequalities, and the politics of language and curriculum. The readings therefore move from a macro level analysis to the micro unit of the school, highlighting both the potential and the limitation of modern day schooling in challenging existing inequalities within society.

Teaching Methodology:
-------------------------------
>Teaching Methodology: The course will blend both synchronous and asynchronous teaching. Online classes will use a mixture of lectures, and group discussions. Students will engage with weekly topics through discussion on a social media class group. They will be required to submit different types of assignments from video/audio reflections, research paper and a final exam.
>Lecture details: The class will be an hour and fifteen minutes, with short recorded lectures shared before class. The synchronous teaching will include a summary of the recorded lecture, discussion on the reading, and questions related to the reading. All lectures will be recorded and stored on LMS. Students need to inform the instructor if they are unable to attend.

DOE,EDU,352,Education Policy Analysis,"Education policy should aim to improve learning outcomes for all pupils in an equitable and conducive environment. At least that is the aspiration when a policy is rolled out into action. However, quite often, outcomes remain at variance with or fall short of the stated objectives of the policy. Education policies are mandated with fanfare, only to find out that the point at which the rubber hits the road, i.e., classrooms and schools, harsh reality comes in the face of the hope and optimism attached with the policy reforms. For example, Pakistan has over seven decades of history of education policy making. Much of this history is replete with sabotaged educational aspirations. One way to effectively understand the variance between stated objectives and outcomes is through analysis of the education policy along such dimensions as how and who framed a ‘problem,’ attached a ‘solution’ to the problem and gave prominence to it in the policy and political ‘agendas.’ How do policy, politics and power intersect to shape education policy? What role do ‘narratives’ play in promoting policy agenda? This course has been designed to explore these and related dimensions of education policy in Pakistan. Anchoring the discussions in the theoretical discourses in the social policy process, the course will explore how education policy has unfolded in Pakistan over the last seven and half decades.

The course will build on theoretical foundations, constructs, and models of social policy process. Selected models include, among others, Multiple Streams Framework, Punctuated Equilibrium, and Innovation and Diffusion Models stemming from social policy research. Other significant dimensions of policy process such as agenda setting, policy alternatives, social constructions, framing of problems, and target population will be explored.

The students of this course will be confronted with questions like:
Are schools sites of social stasis or social transformation? Do they create conditions of emancipation or do they further projects of subordination? What is ‘learnt’ in schools beyond the stated objectives of educationists? What are the promises and limitations of social theory and ethnographic research for educational practice and policy?

In this course, we will explore these questions by: a) readings from social anthropology, philosophy, history and other disciplines; b) studies on various dimensions of education spanning different historical periods and geographic regions around the world; and c) students producing original analysis or research as their final paper

DOE,EDU,372,Mobile Lives: Im/migration and Education,"""The world is experiencing an unprecedented era of human mobility across, and within, borders. With this mass movement of migrants and refugees, borders have become more – not less – relevant with increasing globalization. Managing migrant populations and providing basic social and educational services have become pressing concerns in all regions of the world. The study of ‘Immigration and Education’ presents a very interesting and rich contradiction. Institutionalized systems of education are tied to the interests of the nation state, and yet at the same time are spaces and places essentially characterized by the coming together of people and are symbols of individual and collective aspiration and agency.

This course will provide a broad introduction to theoretical and empirical perspectives that examine the role played by schooling in immigrant incorporation or exclusion, using cases from around the world thematically divided along the lines of South-North, North-North and South-South immigration. We will look at how governments manage increasing diversity and how immigrants strategize to maximize their educational investments. 

Questions that we will address will include how immigrant youth adapt to their new school environments, how the structure and practices of schools influence the student’s engagement with their new surroundings; differences in experiences of first and second-generation youth; the role of gender and immigrant educational experience; notions of citizenship and cosmopolitanism. 

This course primarily uses texts from the fields of sociology, anthropology and geography and thus is highly recommended to those enrolled in social sciences majors. The course is designed to emulate a student-led discussion seminar and as such doing the readings before every class is imperative.""

This course aims to equip students with key behavior analytic knowledge and strategies that allow them to effectively teach a diverse population, including students with special needs such as Autism or ADHD, regardless of class level, or the specific curriculum being taught. We examine the science of behavior, mechanisms of learning and reinforcement, and functional assessment methods to understand the causes of behavior. The course then moves towards setting behavioral objectives for academic goals, developing programs to shape desirable classroom behavior, decrease problem behavior and teach students self-management strategies.

What are the different measures of school effectiveness? Should the benchmarks of ‘effectiveness’ be the same for schools serving in high, middle, and low SES neighborhoods? How does school effectiveness fit in the larger configuration of educational effectiveness knowledge base?

DOE,EDUX,512,The Arts and Education,"This course will introduce current practices of arts education, their historical and philosophical contexts, and emerging directions, globally and in our region. Pakistan has a vibrant tradition of formal education in the arts since the middle of the 19th century. However, till recently, this legacy has had limited outreach and impact on the lives of children, youth, and citizens outside the realm of the art world and the art academy. The arts have a tremendous scope and potential to transform understanding and shift perceptions. If encountered in meaningful ways, they can elicit deep and lasting higher-order thinking in individuals and communities. In the difficult times we are seeing today, particularly with regard to equity, access, criticality, and a loss of the relational aspect of life, mobilizing the arts for peace, resilience, citizenship, and inclusive education has become more crucial than ever before. In this regard, based on an overview of the field, this course aims to investigate, question, interpret and problematize the arts within the context of education through curriculum building, historical analysis, or a generative field inquiry using the arts as a prompt. 

Students will encounter course content through published research in their required and recommended readings, as well as through visual presentations (lecture slides, photos, short films/film excerpts) of practices, contexts, and case studies of arts education by the instructor. In addition, selected guest lectures have also been scheduled with relevant practitioners from our region who will make short presentations of arts education practices in class.

In this course, we attempt to provide an angle of approach to these questions from Islam, focusing on the issues related to businesses. The course’s aim is not to perfunctorily list Islam’s answers to humanity’s seemingly inexhaustible ethical questions related to businesses (e.g., what is halal (ethical) and haram (unethical) regarding situation x). Instead it is to illuminate the process and the framework through which such answers can be grasped.
The course is structured along three modules. In the first module, we investigate the relevance of God to ethics. We also examine the foundations of ethical inquiry in Islam and then compare and contrast this Islamic God-centric ethics with its secular opposite to reach greater clarity on the distinctive nature of the former. This module will equip you with the nature of ethical enquiries in Islam and the process through which ethical issues are to be addressed and resolved in it. The focus of this module is on developing a sound understanding of the framework of ethics in Islam.
The second module looks at some salient ethical issues pertaining to business activities, both at the functional as well as the corporate levels. The background developed of the framework in the earlier module is crucial when we shift to our second module which looks at some Muslim responses to these ethical issues. It is by having a sound knowledge of the framework of ethics in Islam, and a good understanding of the ethical issues in contemporary businesses, that we have a context in which to better situate and critique the Muslim responses that will be discussed in this module and to further explore possibilities of resolving these ethical issues in businesses.
The third module consists of eight spectacular cases covering various aspects of corporate governance. These cases emphasize the inherent form vs substance challenge of corporate governance as well as its all-important ethical dimension. It is expected that deliberation in respect of these cases will highlight the significance of corporate governance in relation to promoting enterprise efficiency, safeguarding the interests of all stakeholders, and creating an environment that is attractive for capital.",0.50,LEC,M05,S1,40,0,Yes,No,2,125,Yes,Not Allowed,Jawad  Sarwar Naqvi Syed,

ENGL,ENGL,2253,"American Dreaming: Reading Race, Nation, and Modernity in Twentieth-Century American Literature","""This is a four Unit sophomore level survey course that scrutinizes the distinctive characteristics of early 20th- Century American Fiction through an intensive investigation of the critically acclaimed masterpieces of four of the principal canonical novelists of this period, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, and John Steinbeck. This period labeled by critics as the “Age of Modernism” felt the full impact of (nineteenth century) developments in biology and geology culminating in a collapse of the old certainties. The outbreak of the ‘Great War’ deepened and intensified the growing disillusionment with the Enlightenment’s promise of progress and human perfectibility. The Irish poet William Butler Yeats encapsulates the tumult and turbulence of this period in the following lines (from “The Second Coming”) “the Centre does not hold/Mere anarchy is loosed on the world”. Ezra Pound sought to give literary and poetic expression to this altered sensibility by urging authors “to make it new”. This fertile, diverse and heterogeneous period witnessed thematic innovations and daring formalist experimentation in the Arts in general and the novel in particular. In this course we will closely scrutinize the nature, scope, and limits of these experiments and achievements with respect to the early 20th century American novel.

A variety of writings articulating different subjective positions on issues that revolve around notions of Muslim identity will be discussed. It is expected that students will have more than a basic knowledge of how to read, understand and interpret critical readings from cross-disciplinary fields.

Building upon this idea this course maps the ways in which human action has irreversibly changed nature as construct (geopolitics) and reality (disasters). Through critical engagement with environmental fiction this course explores the ways in which the violent exploitation of the natural world has generated everyday and epochal crises. We will study various forms of eco-crises—including natural calamities, toxic bodies, climatic extremities and ravaged landscapes—to interpret how their origins lie in the intersections of anthropocentrism, capitalism, and militarism. Focusing on the visual, material and allegorical aspects of texts we will also discuss strategies to narrativize ecological disasters in an evocative and engaging manner. In doing so we will address the potentiality of disaster terminology, debate the degree(s) to which nature is ending, and question the role of human agency in mitigating ecological crises.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,30,0,Yes,No,2,100,Take Home,Not Allowed,"Pirzadeh,Saba","Phase 2: Sophomores, juniors and seniors MGSHSS and SAHSOL can enroll.

We override notions of linearity in the development of ideas, in order to cross and re-cross paths of iteration. We make semiotic alliances with disciplines outside the purviews of literariness, overthrowing the imperialistic forces behind the production and reception of texts. By placing literature under erasure, we encounter those spaces that resist articulation. Desire, sexuality, territory, commodity exchange, morality, aesthetics, state, borderlands, democracy become the focal points in transformation of subjectivities, opening them up to new ways of thinking.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,40,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,Not Allowed,"Sewel,Tom Edward","Phase 2: Open for MGSHSS and SAHSOL Sophomores, juniors and seniors

ENGL,ENGL,4332,Love trumps Hate: The Concept of Love in Contemporary British Drama,"As philosopher Simon May observes in Love: A History (2011), “[a]academic books, chat shows, pop lyrics, internet dating sites, self-help manuals – all buzz with curiosity about the conditions for successful love”. The New York Times column “Modern Love,” which advertises to publish “weekly essays that explore the joys and tribulations of love” since 2004, is just one of countless possible examples for the ubiquity of love as a topic of public interest. As such, the objective of this course is to arrive at a better understanding of a selection of plays by enhancing close, text-based interpretations with an analysis of culturally dominant discourses of love. Even though this book is still primarily intended as a work of literary criticism reaching for a more informed comprehension of specific texts, the enquiry into the formative discourses that shape and influence these texts inevitably places the cultural and social significance as well as the historical evolution of these discourses within the range of vision. As a result, the literary trajectory has been widened by a cultural one to include the contention that an approach that seeks to work out both the historicity and the peculiarities of contemporary conceptions of love is capable of shedding light on one of the most crucial factors that shape and define the time, culture, and society we are part of. In tracing the origins and carving out the distinctive features of contemporary love, this course argues, we may arrive at a deeper understanding of some of the notions, beliefs, and emotional dispositions which determine what Raymond Williams has called the “structure of feeling” (Williams 22–24; see also Sharma/Tygstrup 1–2) of our own day and age.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,25,0,Yes,No,2,100,No,All undergraduate students,"Ali,Farah Hasan","Phase 2: open for MGSHSS and SAHSOL juniors and seniors.

Alongside traditional research methods, students will also be introduced to environmental photography, environmental impact assessment and geospatial mapping. 

The course will be divided into the following parts:
1. Ask Environmental questions
Students will learn the ability to formulate environmental research questions.

2. Acquire Environmental data and resources
Students will learn what methods of data collection will provide best-suited answers and then create the means for collecting that data.  This will include primary and secondary data collection, including survey design and ethics of research.

3. Explore and Analyze Environmental data
Students will learn to analyze the collected data through:
Qualitative Analysis: Ethnographic Approach, Discourse Analysis, Case study method, action research, Environmental Photography

The goal of this course is for students to develop an understanding of the framework of environmental law generally and specifically an understanding and experience of law-doing on matters pertaining to the environment. As such: to gain essential law-doing skills through hands-on experience on real cases and issues related to the environment.
The broader long-term goal is to act as a pilot course to identify ways in which the Law School can provide dedicated research and advocacy support for communities, NGO’s and members of civil society responding to environmental concerns across Pakistan. The Practicum will be a collaborative exercise between SAHSOL and ClientEarth and its partners.

In addition to reinforcing some of the key concepts in finance with a more rigorous and broader perspective, the course focuses on application of finance theory to address strategic issues confronting financial managers in modern corporate settings and financial markets.
The course topics include: managing for value creation; converting strategic plans into cash flow projections and investment decisions; risk and return matrix using CAPM for cost of capital, the capital budgeting process with the application of real options in corporate finance; integrating capital structure and capital budgeting decisions; evaluating acquisition and hostile takeover decisions; valuation of targets given the synergies; and restructuring as a way to increase the value of the firm. 
The course blends theoretical and practical perspectives through lectures, scenarios and cases that typically address multiple issues requiring strategic decisions that interface between the corporation and the capital markets.
Course Modules:
The course is divided into the following modules:

Investment analysis is the foundation step for making rational investment decisions. Investment analysis is the process to study about the price and value of investment in stocks, bonds and real estates. The course is primarily designed for the readers who have good background in finance. Nonetheless, only the strong foundation in finance is not sufficient due to the rigorous nature of the course and a lot of hard work and dedication is expected from the participants. 
The goal of the course is to become familiar with the theory and empirical evidence related to investment analysis and management. 
Topics will include evaluating risk and returns in the context of portfolio construction, optimal portfolio construction, theory of portfolio management, understanding investor’s risk objective and risk tolerance, elements of investor psychology, asset allocation, performance evaluation, and risk measurement. We’ll emphasize stocks, but other investments such as fixed income securities and 
real estate will also be considered. The course is rich in theory and modeling techniques and is focused on development and application of techniques that should be part of the tool kit of those interested in becoming professional investors or portfolio

Futures and Options contracts are actively traded on many international exchanges around the world. In Pakistan futures contracts are traded on PME website also. There is also an over-the-counter market worldwide where the forwards contract, swaps and options contracts are actively traded by financial institutions, fund managers and corporate treasurers. It is the time when those who work in finance, and many outside their fields, understand how derivatives and their markets work, and how to use and prices these instruments.
The course is designed to provide the students an introduction of financial derivatives and fixed income securities. The course is split in two modules. The first module introduces students to important financial derivative instruments: forwards, futures, swaps,
and option contracts. It equips students with essential tools to be applied to understand the derivatives, derivatives markets, and their functioning. In addition to that the course equips students to the general principal of pricing derivatives using no arbitrage 
arguments. 
The second module of the course covers concepts in the fixed income securities and analysis. Past few decades brought tremendous innovations in fixed income securities. These developments have encouraged enormous growths in the fixed income 
markets that eventually led to the sub-prime crisis involving mortgage-backed bonds, collateralized debt obligations and credit derivatives. The crisis highlights some of the dangers of uncontrolled innovations and developments. This course introduces students to the financial world of fixed income securities and their markets, explains the risks of these securities and presents the tools used in their valuations briefly. The course introduces both the theoretical and practical aspects of fixed income investment.

In essence, this course integrates people with numbers by considering their capabilities, their incentives, and the cognitive biases they bring to decision-making. The course covers all stages of the process, from startup to harvest. All the cases concern technology-based businesses, 
though the emphasis is on gaining insights into entrepreneurial management and venture financing, 
not technology per se. 
The course helps the entrepreneurs with tools and techniques to understand the economic risk and 
returns of startups to harvest, identify and evaluate funding sources, developing insights into the 
business-evaluation tools of the venture capitalists, the actual proforma valuations, the deal structuring which includes preparing term-sheets with legal jargon and negotiations on key 
assumptions, and finally planning the VC exists. On the other hand, the course takes the VC position 
and discusses questions such as how a VC can divide the fund into pieces and sell it to receive better 
IRR? It discusses, how VCs look at the business, build initial interest, and what makes them excited to 
go for full analysis until the time funding takes place? The course helps to develop idea pitching skills
as well.
The course is aimed primarily at students who may be involved in an entrepreneurial venture at some 
point in their careers whether in a large organization, a turnaround, a management buyout, or a 
startup. The course will also be useful for future private equity decision-makers. The course has been 
divided into the following modules:

Global Governance debate transcends conventional and traditional international system’s straightjacket analyses and examines the profound changes that have taken place in international system since post-cold war period. Global governance thus examines the conduct and behavior of states, international organizations, civil society and corporations as well as role of active group of citizens who shape policies at the domestic and international levels. Broadly the debate of GG addresses political, economic legal, social, peace and security and human rights issues. In recent times profound impact of global financial crisis, pandemics, climate change have added to the debate of global governance.

China’s rise in the first decade of the 21st century as economic powerhouse and becoming member of World Trade Organization was a watershed in multilateral economic relations in the world. As rising power in the world, China has incrementally joined formal and informal networks of decision-making and has contributed in enriching debate, sometimes concurring with the other major powers and on occasions presenting her own view, as to how the global governance may be shaped. China also present her own global and regional view on peace and security, economic development and has been an active player through her multilateral institutions by investing parallel to IBRD in developing countries in infrastructure across all continents. AIIB is one such example. Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has opened up alternative avenues for developing countries.

Within China the most remarkable achievement has been successful poverty alleviation programs, which has taken out 850 million Chinese from poverty trap. Communist Party of China (One party rule) is often critically viewed and democracy is measured though Western lens and the West come to defense of democracy in the face of increasing Chinese global power. We will also closely look at the role of China in global environmental, financial and health governance.

the Sudan, Mali, Nicaragua, the U.S., China, India, France, Thailand, Papa New Guinea, Afghanistan, Korea, Lebanon and Japan, as
well as women who are displaced around the world.
During the term we will examine some of the typical roles women play in society; the cultural rationales and structural conditions
behind practices like female circumcision and women’s acceptance of and resistance to such practices; the globalization of work,
sex, and ideas of female beauty; the influence different forms of social organization have on women’s lives; media images of
women; and women’s social activism and development work on behalf of women. We will also spend a significant portion of the
course critically deconstructing powder dynamics within the feminist movement, examining the impacts of western and neoliberal
feminisms, as well as the significant contributions of black, postcolonial, and indigenous feminists towards gender, sexuality, and
race-based rights.
As anthropologists we will be striving to acquire an insider’s perspective, but we will also examine the opinions of outsiders who
typically view other women’s lives through the filter of their own culture. We will be reading about and watching films which show
both women’s victimization as well as their agency and collective efforts to create better lives for themselves and for their societies

The course will assume a basic knowledge of gender studies. Students should have taken at least one GSS core or elective course as a prerequisite. The course will provide an overview of theories related to the social construction of masculinity. The course will then look at masculinities as they intersect with other forms of social stratification including race, ethnicity and class. Finally, as much of the literature on masculinities is focused on Europe and North America, the final third of the course will explore the role of masculinity in South Asian political and religious violence including analysing the Shiv Sena in India and the MQM and Islamism in Pakistan. It will also explore non-violent manifestations of South Asian masculinities, particularly as they relate to education and migration.

In this course, we closely examine a variety of screen texts to understand and breakdown the representation of gender and the role of the city as seen in popular culture and created through independent processes. We begin with an examination of early screen texts and a discussion on gender and urban development to lay a foundation for the analysis of modern-day conversations between gender and the city. Here we examine the portrayal of women and their interaction both with and within the city. As we continue our analysis, we look at how the portrayal of men has changed and explore the idea of the growing crisis of masculinity in the urban setting. At the same time, we acknowledge non-binary expressions of gender identities, the evolution of technology and digital formats and the physical and emotional anxieties apparent in urban spaces through migration and movement.

SWGI,GSS,366,"Gender, Nationalism, and Politics: Unpacking media master narratives in South Asia","South Asia is a region with an interesting past and present when it comes to the systemic political and social marginalization of 
women. While on the one hand, the region tends to hold fast to regressive and antiquated notions of ‘honour’ – national, ethnic, 
religious, and individual – that is mapped along female and feminine bodies, it is also a region that has repeatedly produced 
prominent female leaders and heads of state. Given the violent patriarchal cultures that still prevail in many South Asian nations, this 
is an intriguing dichotomy that warrants exploration. In her piece ‘Why Do South and Southeast Asians Vote for Female Heads of 
State?’, Lavanga Wijekoon asks “Given the relatively low status of women in this region, one questions why these societies voted for 
women to lead their respective countries; how so many women have occupied the highest echelons of power while their country 
women suffered from discrimination, poverty, illiteracy and other societal woes?” 
The proposed course aims to explore these questions in deeper detail by centralizing how Gender relations intersect with 
Nationalism, Parliamentary Politics, and Media narrative framing in the South Asian political landscape. This course will unpack 
how women’s bodies are repeatedly used and weaponized as a metaphor for National ‘honour’ and the varied consequences of such
framing for the region and its implications in transnational contexts. Students will be expected to engage with the reading materials 
by contextualizing them in contemporary media coverage from various South Asian regions and newsworthy cases and coverage will 
be analyzed and contextualized in light of the readings during class discussions. 
This course is designed to provide students with a theoretical grounding in gender and politics while encouraging them to frame 
these debates in a contemporary local context by engaging with media coverage, working on investigative news features for their 
final project and familiarizing themselves with the Pakistani parliamentary process and women’s role in it. Several guest speakers 
will be invited from media and other public spheres to discuss the everyday engagement with gendered issues in Pakistan so that 
students can be exposed to shifting local, sociocultural, and political terrain.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,20,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,All undergraduate students,"Amir,Maria","Phase 2: Open for MGSHSS and SAHSOL sophomores, juniors and seniors

SWGI,GSS,367,"Folklore Futures: Negotiating, Reclaiming, and Reimagining Indigeneity through Storytelling","One of the most common refrains heard for many of today’s social and cultural shifts is that Pakistan is beleaguered by ‘Western’

and ‘Foreign’ influence. The idea that progress is an exclusively ‘western’ notion is a deeply entrenched view that needs to be

challenged. Pakistan’s folk traditions – whether Punjabi, Sindhi, Baloch, Pashtun or others, include many deeply rebellious, spiritual,

and progressive messages that have seldom been framed or communicated to young people in contemporary contexts and settings.

This includes everything from the qissas of Hir, Sohni, Sassi, and Sahiban to Punjabi female dance forms of Gidda Boliyan and

Tappay, to Sindhi Sufi shrine cultures and Pashtun fabrics and embroidery. Many are unaware of the immense repository of stories

that already exist in the centuries-long history of the indigenous land that is present day Pakistan.

This course is an attempt to repurpose many Indigenous research and decolonizing methodologies with regards to introducing young

people to folklore, folk art, and what being part of ‘folk’ means. Most folklore around the world draws from women’s knowledge,

story- telling, and craft traditions and the bulk of the contemporary readings in this course approach indigeneity and folklore from an

explicitly feminist and queer lens.

The proposed course aims to help students understand and develop links with indigenous cultures and traditions from the

subcontinent. Various elements of indigenous culture are explored within the course through in-class performances i.e., oral

storytelling, music, dance, craft, fabric, and language etc. The course is structured primarily as an exploratory grassroots exercise

where students will be asked to find contemporary ways of connecting with and exploring their own indigenous cultures, from

objects and stories that have been present in their family for generations. Students will be encouraged to centralize themselves in the

act of storytelling and how they choose to express it, i.e. as a qissa performance, a dance performance, musical performance,

documentary project or other mediums that will allow them to trace and incorporate family, tribal, or provincial local legends and

folklore in their projects. Several guest speakers will assist the students in utilizing performance, musical and theatrical tools to

explore both old and new forms of indigenous story telling. Student’s will also work on indigenous feminist traditions from a variety

of cultures that incorporate a blend of methodologies, theory, and praxis, towards helping them develop a contemporary

understanding of folklore so they may access it for their own purposes. Students will also be encouraged to develop and explore their

own folklore traditions by unpacking existing folklore in various sociopolitical and gendered contexts with the aim of incorporating

it in contemporary settings through a variety of mediums such as film, theatre and/or craft. Students will be expected to engage on a

personal level with the subject matter and write about their experiences in tracing lineages, family trees, local, ethnic, and family

lore, and other aspects of indigeneity through in-class performances, written assignments, storytelling, field journals, or other platforms. The course will help students to use myth, folklore, and indigeneity to explore both historical and contemporary questions of gender, identity, and culture by also providing them with the theoretical and performance tools required to navigate these vast domains for themselves in new and exciting ways.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,29,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,All undergraduate students,"Amir,Maria","Phase 1: Open for Juniors and seniors of MGSHSS (except Econ).

SWGI,GSS,463,Love trumps Hate: The Concept of Love in Contemporary British Drama,"As philosopher Simon May observes in Love: A History (2011), “[a]academic books, chat shows, pop lyrics, internet dating sites, self-help manuals – all buzz with curiosity about the conditions for successful love”. The New York Times column “Modern Love,” which advertises to publish “weekly essays that explore the joys and tribulations of love” since 2004, is just one of countless possible examples for the ubiquity of love as a topic of public interest. As such, the objective of this course is to arrive at a better understanding of a selection of plays by enhancing close, text-based interpretations with an analysis of culturally dominant discourses of love. Even though this book is still primarily intended as a work of literary criticism reaching for a more informed comprehension of specific texts, the enquiry into the formative discourses that shape and influence these texts inevitably places the cultural and social significance as well as the historical evolution of these discourses within the range of vision. As a result, the literary trajectory has been widened by a cultural one to include the contention that an approach that seeks to work out both the historicity and the peculiarities of contemporary conceptions of love is capable of shedding light on one of the most crucial factors that shape and define the time, culture, and society we are part of. In tracing the origins and carving out the distinctive features of contemporary love, this course argues, we may arrive at a deeper understanding of some of the notions, beliefs, and emotional dispositions which determine what Raymond Williams has called the “structure of feeling” (Williams 22–24; see also Sharma/Tygstrup 1–2) of our own day and age.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,5,0,Yes,No,2,100,No,All undergraduate students,"Ali,Farah Hasan","Phase 1: Open for Juniors and seniors of MGSHSS (except Econ).

HSS,HIST,2202,The Indian Ocean,"Imagine a map scaled not by abstract distance between two cities, but by the time it took for people to move between those places before the advent of air travel. In such a map, the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean shrinks into a small lake, around which a majority of the world’s urban population has historically lived. Despite living in close proximity, the entangled histories of societies around the Indian Ocean are usually compartmentalized into different nations. A growing set of literature on the Indian Ocean has begun connecting these places through larger structural systems of trade, empires, and religion. In this class, however, we will approach the Indian Ocean through the microhistories of those who lived in this interconnected space. We will ask: how did people experience life in the multi-ethnic and politically divided, yet interdependent world of the Indian Ocean? What brought people together, and what kept them apart? 

In this class we will read grounded accounts of life around the ocean: primary documents such as diaries, letters, manuscripts, and travelogues, microhistories, historical fiction, and ethnographies. Through an assortment of narrative-driven and detail-rich sources, we will develop a diverse set of characters, inextricably tied to the Indian Ocean through social, religious, economic, and political networks. The course is chronologically divided into four different sections, namely, early modern, the long 19th century, the short 20th century, and the global 21st century.

HISTORY,HIST,2213,Foundations of Modern South Asian History,"This survey course offers a perspective on the diverging views of South Asia’s past. We will begin with a discussion on the historical, political, and geographical settings of South Asia from the early ancient period, including a discussion of important historical events, such as the development of trade relations along what is now known as the ‘Silk Route,’ and the history of the Indus Valley Civilisation. We will discuss the ascendancy of Muslim political authority in South Asia and its dynastic continuity from the 11th century onwards within the prism of various social and religious factors. Such an approach will enable us to offer a more nuanced understanding of the complexity of historical processes shaping the region during this period. The trade link between South Asia and European trading companies serves as a point of entry from which to discuss South Asian history in a broader context and link it with global developments.
A critical component of this course deals with European powers’ territorial domination and the administrative, economic, and social changes it brought to South Asia. Again, this will serve as a starting point for a critical conceptual discussion on colonialism, Orientalism, and modernity within the context of South Asia and beyond.
Towards the end, we will study the period of resistance against British colonial rule within the discussion framework on such broader issues as gender, caste, communalism, movements for religious reform, the rising influence of socialism, and the impact of World Wars. Finally, we will also cover the trajectories of influential South Asian politicians and moral leaders, including Syed Ahmad Khan, Gandhi, Tagore, Bhagat Singh, Nehru, and Ambedkar, whose individual trajectories transcended the nation-state but who have been selectively remembered in both countries after 1947.

HISTORY,HIST,312,Mughal Architecture: Babur to Aurangzeb,"""This course is designed to familiarize students with the architectural heritage of Lahore and the
different chapters of history it features. Both private and public buildings of the three significant
pre-Partition architectural styles: Mughal, Sikh and British Raj will be studied and compared with
each other. The objective is to study how the ornamental vocabulary used in each era expresses
contemporaneous attitudes and how it can be read as a record of political and social culture that
surrounded and molded them.
Mughal architecture is considered to be the most creative period in the history of the Indian
Subcontinent. A survey of the important Mughal monuments in Lahore will be the starting point
for the course. Salient features of Mughal architectural ornament will be highlighted along with
elements that reflect pre-Mughal styles – both Islamic Indian and Hindu for a holistic
understanding.
Sikh architecture is the indigenous style that followed the Mughal mode. Although bearing strong
similarities with its forerunner, the Sikh vocabulary is distinctly different. In order to discern and
appreciate its unique features, the students will be given a systematic comparison with the earlier

HISTORY,HIST,4203,Orientalism,"Edward Said’s magisterial Orientalism (1978) altered, perhaps irrevocably, the cultural implications and literal bearings of a term that for almost two centuries prior designated the meticulous scholarly study of territories that lay to the east of Europe. Comprehensive and ambitious, the systematic attempt to understand the Orient was essentially a philological one, but that on account of the scope afforded by the latter category came to encompass a much broader domain. In this course, we will try to trace the transformation of a discipline whose initial emergence is tied to the moment of the European Enlightenment, and that takes on new dimensions with the rise of the imperial endeavor. We can also imagine this transformation as mediated by Europe’s varied commercial and colonial interests in two separate “Orients,” Islamicate and Indic. Over the course of the semester, we will grapple with precisely these issues: how and why does Europe choose to imagine the Islamic East in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries through the modes that it does? What happens to this category of an Islamic East in the European narrative when faced with the question of a classical Indic Orient? With the consolidation of an imperial presence in India, how do the cultural implements of Orientalism actually alter and reconfigure certain “pre-colonial” modes? Our primary texts range from the “literary” or fictional to the scientific, illustrating the breadth of the discipline and the trajectories of its influence from the metropolis to the late colonial formation.",4.00,SEM,16W,M1,5,0,Yes,No,1,200,No,Not Allowed,"Wasif Khan,Maryam","Phase 2: All MGSHSS junior and senior

It is a dynamic and interactive course organized around projects undertaken by teams of 3-5 students. This course is designed not only for students with immediate entrepreneurial aspirations in healthcare, but also for any student considering starting an entrepreneurial venture at some point in his or her career. In the first two weeks, teams will research, craft, test and morph their idea into a viable business concept. In the remaining weeks of the semester, they will further refine their concept and develop a strategy and plan to attract financial, human and other resources. At the end of the semester, teams will submit as well as present their business plan for a grade. The course builds on important research and finding as they relate to the process of new venture creation. The teaching method is primarily learning by doing through a structured process, supported by relevant cases, lectures and exercises. Rigorous class discussions are fundamental to the SDSB learning experience, especially in a case study class environment. Students should contribute to the class by exhibiting an understanding of the case study by presenting their analysis of the situation and advocating specific recommendations using prior learnings from the class.  Participation in each class session is crucial for academic success and students should be ready for follow up questions and internal class debates.

Team formation for the course will take place during the first week of the course. During the course of the semester, students are expected to prepare certain group-specific deliverables, craft a business plan and pitch presentations. Class discussions led by course instructors as well as business individuals drawn from various domains will enrich learning experience.

BUSINESS PLAN AND PRESENTATIONS 

The primary deliverables are an initial pitch to the instructors (to include a PowerPoint presentation) for idea selection, a final presentation and a written business plan highlighting the essential features of the business, market, competition, operating plan and financial projections, etc. and a separate executive summary of the business plan.

LAW,LAW,345,"Crime, Justice, and Society","This course invites participants to dive into thinking of crime and ideas of justice outside of the conventional, often sensationalist, lens. To do this, the course explores core concepts of Criminology and Penology and theories of law, and then asks what a Criminology for South Asia can look like. Arguably, Criminology is an older phenomenon in South Asia than in other parts of the world, tied to criminalising specific identities, the formulation of the Penal Code and design of prisons in South Asia. Therefore, participants will think critically and structurally about causes of crime (both individualised and collective/social), institutional responses (courts and prisons), and a context for understanding structural complexities, ideas and approaches to the very subjective idea of justice, thereby challenging conventional myths. 
 To do this, the course is designed to step out of conventional, often simplistic understanding of crime and the role of courts and prisons. This is done via a multidisciplinary approach, consisting of theoretical explanations from around the world. The course is therefore divided into three parts, each exploring theories on crime, prisons and the symbol and site of courts.

This course will explore a relatively new field of international law and yet a vast subject in and of itself, international criminal law. It will aim to give students an accessible yet challenging introduction of this regime of law. It will focus on the crimes within the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals – genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression. It will also explore the jurisdictional bases of ICL, the conduct and mental elements of these crimes, and the defences under customary law and the Rome Statute. It will further analyse the history of international criminal tribunals (such as the International Military Tribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo; the International Criminal Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the International Criminal Court; and ‘hybrid’ tribunals like those for Sierra Leone, Cambodia and Lebanon).

This course will also analyse the complexities of international criminal law, such as long-standing debates over the crime of aggression and aspects of individual responsibility. We will also consider alternatives and complements to criminal accountability, particularly in the Rwandan and South African contexts through gacaca courts and truth and reconciliation commissions. As Pakistan has not ratified the Rome Statute we will also discuss the pros and cons of accession.

Students should by the end of the course have in-depth knowledge of the jurisdictional bases of international criminal law, the ‘core crimes’ and their key elements, as well as the key debates in assigning individual criminal responsibility. They will be aware of how individual accountability is pursued situated alongside notions of state consent and how we define these crimes.",2.00,SEM,16W,M1,25,0,Yes,No,1,100,Yes,All undergraduate students,"Alam Malik,Ayesha",Course will remain open to LLB second + third year students & non-law juniors and seniors. 5 reserved seats for non-law students.
LAW,LAW,353,Human Rights,"This course intends to introduce students to Human Rights as a regime, method of practice and strategy, and as an intellectual sub-discipline of law. Further, the course is intended to train students as practitioners versed in the doctrine, practice, and skills of human rights advocacy, sensitive to the fact that the content of what is considered human rights is evolving and tied to emerging social movements. Accordingly, the course is construed not only as concerning Human Rights Law, narrowly encompassing international and regional law instruments, but also as engaging with the policy and practice of human rights, and including a view of the doctrine of human rights as a historical development in response to identified violations of human dignity. Participants in the course will learn not only the law, but ways of analysis, seeing, and witnessing that enable them to diagnose human rights problems as skilled practitioners concerned with human needs and versed in legal and policy analysis in the subject. For this semester-long project, students will engage mostly with legal texts, including international human rights instruments, case-law, and guiding commentaries by relevant treaty bodies, but will also read from human rights reports issued by witnessing NGOs, examine case-studies from various jurisdictions and societies, meet with practitioners in the local context, and consider academic critiques to both the primacy of the rights doctrine and the flaws in its present practice. Students will have the opportunity to work closely on a particular human rights issue of concern to them, with reference to the relevant legal instruments and with sensitivity to the context in which the violation occurs. Since the object of the course is to train skilled rights practitioners and advocates, there will be a heavy emphasis on technical ways of writing: students will be introduced to memo- and report-writing that incorporates both legal and policy analysis. This is to emphasize that, in the inescapably political realm of human rights work, the doctrine provides the base for advocacy but is not the end-point in ensuring respect for the human rights of vulnerable or victimized persons.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,25,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,All undergraduate students,"Sattar,Adnan","Course will open for LLB second and third year students during phase I.

The business of transport of goods by sea and is obviously risky. The cargo may arrive late or not at all. Pandemics, natural disasters and other unforeseen events may hinder transportation leading to of breaches of contract and losses. How are the various risks allocated between the parties who might have a financial interest in the ship and her cargo? 

The selling and purchasing of goods across territorial borders is an ancient yet sophisticated commercial activity. International transport of goods involves interlocking contracts, including letters of credit and contracts of sale, carriage and insurance, all of which concern the minds of buyers and sellers whilst performing this activity for profit. 

Using a case-based approach, the course develops a thorough understanding of the key aspects of the law of international transport of goods by sea and their practical implications in light of the commonly used standard form documents such as charterparties and bills of lading. It raises awareness of the major mandatorily applicable international regimes, as well as the recent discussions and attempts to bring uniformity in this area.

LAW,LAW,424,Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration,"With increasing cross-border trade and investments, international arbitration has developed into the mainstream mechanism for resolution of transnational disputes. Arbitration clauses are now a part of nearly every commercial and investment agreement. 

International arbitration gains traction and support from a robust international legal framework. The New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards has 156 signatories. Around 72 States (and 102 jurisdictions) have adopted legislation based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (1985), as amended. Apart from this legal support, arbitration promises flexibility, neutrality, confidentiality, and efficiency in terms of time and cost. These factors are not usually available in court litigation. The importance of international arbitration is, therefore, only going to increase with time.

This course explores some of the major issues concerning international arbitration law and practice by focusing on the interaction between arbitration and domestic courts.

The course is schematically divided into three parts. The first part deals with issues relating to arbitration agreement such as essential terms, obligations, and enforceability, etc., of the arbitration agreement as well as arbitrability and seperability principles. The second part engages with the arbitral process: the commencement of arbitration, appointment of arbitrators, challenge to arbitrators, provisional measures, and evidentiary issues. The third part turns the focus on the arbitral award, its recognition and enforcement, and recourse against international arbitral awards.

Lastly, the course will also engage with the theoretical foundations and some of the major criticisms directed towards arbitration.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,20,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,Not Allowed,"Chaudhry,Muhammad Umer Akram",Course will only remain open to LLB second and third year students.

LAW,LAW,4312,Expression Confined,"Expression Confined
Article 19 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 ('Constitution') grants freedom of expression and press, in addition to adding seven layers of limitations. The relevant excerpt is reproduced below:

“Every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, and there shall be freedom of the press, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, 1[commission of] or incitement to an offence ”

The question of the confined understanding of this fundamental right comes up time and again, whether it is in the context of banning literature (such as ensuing litigation against Manto), to banning social media platforms through PEMRA, PTA and other state agencies and Social Media Rules, 2020; or prohibiting speech against the Constitutional courts and the armed forces; or the balancing of expression with other fundamental rights including freedom of religion - this provision has always been a source of contention through Pakistan’s history.

This course is a qualitative methods course focusing largely on teaching ethnographic methods. The goal of this seminar is for each student to understand ethnographic methods and the stakes of how they choose to explore and interrogate their chosen sites. The goal of this seminar is for each student to develop a research design specific to their chosen site, by which I mean an approach that is elicited from the material and immaterial relationships articulated at their site. This course calls for a thinking with a site, instead of about it, through endless experimentation.

At the heart of this course is the offering that the ways in which we engage, explore, and story the world is a question of power. With this in mind, we will attempt to articulate research sensibilities and modes of inquiry that exceed traditional interviewing and writing practices, experimenting with modes of attention that find inspiration in anti-colonial and black method. Through this, the course will attempt to cultivate ways of seeing that are more subversive and attentive to power, encouraging the students to harness qualities of attentiveness in their research practice that deconstruct the colonial spirit of perception and inquiry, re-conceptualizing, as it were, ethnography.

This course is important for law students to acquaint them with disparate research methods, practices, and interpretative tools, and importantly, in problematizing disciplinary requirements of impartiality, neutrality, and objectivity, all of which are written into the task of both anthropological and legal knowledge production.",2.00,SEM,16W,M1,25,0,Yes,No,1,100,No,All undergraduate students,"Paracha,Nida Iftikhar",Course will remain open to LLB second + third year students & non-law juniors + seniors. 5 seats reserved for non-law students.

LAW,LAW,4905,"Law, Social Change, and Resistance","Law, Social Change, and Resistance
This course aims to explore the relationship of law with political economy, social movements, and resistance from an interdisciplinary and critical perspective. The main question it hopes to address is how the law is shaped by its interaction with social movements and resistance of the marginalized and whether they can use it to effect social change at both institutional and structural levels.

Legal scholars and practitioners in the third world, despite being influenced by critical legal studies, law and society, critical race theory, law and political economy, and other theoretical interventions developed in the Western context, have developed their own post-colonial variants and imaginative and creative understanding of socio-political change. While Western interventions have sought to theorize how the law is shaped and structured in the context of the bourgeois liberal project in Western democracies, adopting a nihilistic view of socio-political change, they have remained in the realm of social democracy and social movement-ism, accepting that the legal form is unchangeable.

The first part of this course will address these questions by looking at the critical theoretical interventions in law, political economy, and social movements to ask what gives content and structure to the law. It will explore both how the law is shaped by its interaction with social movements and resistance struggles of the marginalized (particularly in the third world) and the effect the law and legal struggles have had on these movements.


The second part of this course will look at theoretical interventions in legal practice from the perspective of social movements and resistance struggles of the marginalized. By charting the development of trends including critical lawyering, rebellious lawyering, community lawyering, collaborative lawyering, and more recent interventions such as movement lawyering as well as new scholarship in the context of public interest litigation in the third world, especially South Asia, it will see how resistance struggles of the marginalized, and social movements in the third-world, have sought to use legal struggles and explore if, and how, legal struggles can be used by movements of the marginalized to aid social change.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,30,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,All undergraduate students,"Ali,Muhammad Umar",10 seats reserved for non-law juniors & seniors.

ACF,MGMT,252,Logic and Critical Thinking,"Even though thinking is a natural activity, much of our thinking is confounded by distortions, biases and prejudices, and is in many instances uninformed and partial.

ACF,MGMT,321,International Business,"""The last two decades have witnessed unprecedented activity in the arena of international business. The world trade has skyrocketed, foreign direct investments have ballooned and cross-border mergers & acquisitions have substantially increased. Interestingly, the world is now staring at the prospects of a grim and lengthy recession, comparable only to great depression of 1930s, with many pointing fingers to the evils of globalization. Nonetheless, regardless of our love or hate for the interconnected world of 21st
century, the businesses have no choice but to understand the mechanisms and intricacies of international business, in order to operate effectively in today’s seemingly turbulent markets.
The objective of this course is to provide the course participants an understanding of international business from a global and multinational management perspective. The curriculum provides an understanding of the dynamics of international business. The course mainly focuses on two areas – the environmental components of international business and the strategy & operations of the multinationals in a changing global economy. The relevance of various issues to Pakistani businesses will also be debated, wherever applicable.
This course has been designed to be challenging, and interesting. It deals with the contemporary topics, and also the concepts that have been well established in this domain over the past couple of decades. The course requires prior understanding of basic management principles. Therefore, students seeking enrollment must have taken the basic management courses

As state’s engagement with citizens’ lives progressively grew in the post-world war II era, there were extensive debates among academics and practitioners on the theoretical foundations of such engagement. Questions on the areas of intervention, its extent, and the most appropriate modes of intervention were hotly debated. Although debates on these issues have a much longer history, they intensified in the recent past as public service provision grew from nominal to extensive in most countries. By no means modern theory on social policy was limited to theorizing the role of the state – it also critically examined the role of the market, family and philanthropy. Especially during the last two decades, the realization has grown that citizens’ well-being largely depends upon the interplay of the state, the market, the family and philanthropy.",3.00,LEC,16W,S1,60,5,Yes,No,2,75,Yes,All undergraduate students,Muhammad  Ahsan Rana,"Enrollment Phase 1: SDSB Junior, Senior

ACF,MGMT,481,Entrepreneurship,"Entrepreneurship is about turning an idea into a valuable enterprise under a certain level of uncertainty by remaining in control of what you want to achieve and how you want to achieve it”

Welcome to be a part of the entrepreneurial revolution that has literally ‘infected’ the contemporary global thinking! No other jargon has so much in use in recent times as entrepreneurship, and it is certainly for a reason. That is, perhaps no other thing can be so powerful, sustainable and thrilling as the phenomenon of ‘new venture creation’ for its ability to solve the prevailing problem of the mankind in its entirety.  It is an introductory course on entrepreneurship intended to enhance your ‘willingness’ to set out on an entrepreneurial journey and give you a chance to think about alternative career options available to you in an economy so full of unmet needs and so short of innovative solutions. In this semester we will assess, explore, critique and celebrate the phenomenon of entrepreneurship. 

This course will approach entrepreneurship as a mindset, an attitude and a behaviour to undertake value-creating initiatives in situations with a certain level of uncertainty that is expected to lead to the creation of a new business entity, be it a new start-up or a launch of new product or service within a large corporation. The course is designed in six modules with almost equal focus on the students’ development of both hard and soft entrepreneurial skills. The discussion in the first three modules will predominantly revolve around the cognitive part of the entrepreneurship process, which will allow the students to understand and challenge the very ‘logic’ of how expert entrepreneurs usually make decisions as opposed to a stereotypical manager working under a very different scheme of things. The last three modules of the course will then deal with some contemporary analytical tools used in the entrepreneurship education, coupled with certain ‘tricks of the trade’, to generally improve the students’ skills to develop a more innovative and sustainable business model for whatever entrepreneurial pursuit they ever plan to undertake.  This course, therefore, promises a unique form of logic, which might at times be antagonistic to the conventional principles of management, but then it is what entrepreneurship is all about. 

Given the nature of the subject, the curriculum of this course will also ensure a substantial exposure to the living practice of entrepreneurship through certain assignments, case study discussions and the guest speaker sessions that will be organized in the university. Students will get an adequate chance to interact with different practicing entrepreneurs at different points along the course to validate their classroom learning and refine their business ideas.  In short, this course promises a blend of fun and learning.",3.00,LEC,16W,S1,60,5,Yes,No,2,75,Yes,Not Allowed,Sahar  Arif,"Enrollment Phase 1: SDSB Junior, Senior

PHYSICS,PHY, 417,Introduction to Quantum Information Science and Technology,"This course has two parts. The first deals with the basics of quantum computing. We will learn how to perform computations using simple quantum operations, called quantum gates. We will also build basic algorithms to show that quantum computers are faster than classical computers in solving some problems. The second part deals with quantum information that generalizes concepts from classical information theory.

To organize our exploration of this subfield, we will use violence and power as twin lenses through which to view the realm of the political. Throughout the semester, we will ask what anthropology offers to help us understand the horror of political violence, and what we can glean about the nature of the political from the ethnographic realities of anger, joy, devastation, and hope.

POLSCI,POL,365,"Gender, Nationalism, and Politics: Unpacking media master narratives in South Asia","South Asia is a region with an interesting past and present when it comes to the systemic political and social marginalization of 
women. While on the one hand, the region tends to hold fast to regressive and antiquated notions of ‘honour’ – national, ethnic, 
religious, and individual – that is mapped along female and feminine bodies, it is also a region that has repeatedly produced 
prominent female leaders and heads of state. Given the violent patriarchal cultures that still prevail in many South Asian nations, this 
is an intriguing dichotomy that warrants exploration. In her piece ‘Why Do South and Southeast Asians Vote for Female Heads of 
State?’, Lavanga Wijekoon asks “Given the relatively low status of women in this region, one questions why these societies voted for 
women to lead their respective countries; how so many women have occupied the highest echelons of power while their country 
women suffered from discrimination, poverty, illiteracy and other societal woes?” 
The proposed course aims to explore these questions in deeper detail by centralizing how Gender relations intersect with 
Nationalism, Parliamentary Politics, and Media narrative framing in the South Asian political landscape. This course will unpack 
how women’s bodies are repeatedly used and weaponized as a metaphor for National ‘honour’ and the varied consequences of such
framing for the region and its implications in transnational contexts. Students will be expected to engage with the reading materials 
by contextualizing them in contemporary media coverage from various South Asian regions and newsworthy cases and coverage will 
be analyzed and contextualized in light of the readings during class discussions. 
This course is designed to provide students with a theoretical grounding in gender and politics while encouraging them to frame 
these debates in a contemporary local context by engaging with media coverage, working on investigative news features for their 
final project and familiarizing themselves with the Pakistani parliamentary process and women’s role in it. Several guest speakers 
will be invited from media and other public spheres to discuss the everyday engagement with gendered issues in Pakistan so that 
students can be exposed to shifting local, sociocultural, and political terrain.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,20,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,All undergraduate students,"Amir,Maria","Phase 1: Open for POL, ECON/POL Juniors and Seniors

POLSCI,POL,443,Political Entrepreneurs,"This course seeks to examine the role of political actors in determining ‘who gets what, where and how?’ The role of politicians and other power brokers in less developed countries is a neglected area in Political Science because it is either subsumed under the category of ‘patronage politics’ or ignored in favor of focusing on structural economic forces and institutional constraints that makes what politicians do largely irrelevant.  Political science as a discipline emerged out of Western classical liberalism with its attendant assumptions about desirable features of political institutions.  Patronage delivered through ‘political machines’ in major cities in United States came to exemplify the corruption that must be rooted out through reformist agenda that in more recent times have been enshrined as ‘good governance.’ Critical examination of assumptions underlying the ‘good governance’ versus corrupt politicians opens a space for examining political dynamics in less developed countries. 
The course is divided into four modules.  The first modules bring a critical lens to the distinction between ‘good governance’ and corrupt politicians.  We start with Machiavelli’s “The Prince” to develop a conceptual framework for understanding combination of skills and circumstances that shape what politicians do. Next, we move to the turn of 20th century urban United States where machine politics was pitted against a reformist agenda. We will conclude this section by examining the life and career of Robert Moses from a reformist to a power broker who innovated the use of highway tolls to create public authority with the ability to raise massive revenues and use those revenues to change the face of New York City. 
Second module will focus on variety of ways in which political power is accumulated and exercised in South Asia from neighborhoods to cities to provincial and national levels. 
Third module will explore cases where politicians expand and solidify their political base by pursuing pro-poor policies. 
The last section of the course will explore Pakistan’s version of ‘corrupt’ machine politics and reformist technocrats and will apply the taxonomy developed at the end of the third module to key politician’s attempt to introduce pro-poor policies.

BUSADM,SCRM,6202,Supply Management,"In today’s world of competitiveness supply-chains compete with supply-chains rather than individual organizations. Therefore, purchasing has evolved to occupy a strategic position, with suppliers becoming key stakeholders in quest of business organizations to earn a sustainable competitive advantage. Progressive businesses no more consider purchasing as a transactional activity, rather they contemplate the activity within the broader framework of supply management, which considers suppliers as an extension of the focal firm. 
In this context, this course intends to introduce students with the contemporary approaches of supply management. Strategic focus of the supply management will be emphasized while discussing such topics as strategic role of sourcing, supplier and relationship development, strategic negotiations with supply partners, management of supply channel, procurement life cycle, e-procurement, supplier capability development, supply risk management, global sourcing and supply related performance management. These learning goals will be achieved with the support of variety of teaching tools such as case studies, exercises, simulations, and interactive lectures.",3.00,LEC,MS2,S1,40,0,Yes,No,3,120,Yes,Not Allowed,"Jajja,Muhammad Shakeel Sadiq",

ANTH&SOC,SOC,223,Sociology of Education,"The education system is both a source of perpetuating socio-economic inequalities, and a tool for challenging the status quo. Educational institutions, especially schools are an integral part of the socialization process, preparing the next generation to take on their role as “social” actors. The course examines how and why the education system perpetuates or challenges existing inequalities within society. It introduces students to sociological theories of education, examining the intersection between education, class, culture, gender, resistance and democracy. The first part provides a macro level analysis of education and its place within society by introducing students to grand theories of education with a particular emphasis on functionalism, pragmatism, and critical pedagogy. The second part focuses on the formalized education system, in particular the school, examining the structure and organization of the school, teaching and pedagogy, classroom inequalities, and the politics of language and curriculum. The readings therefore move from a macro level analysis to the micro unit of the school, highlighting both the potential and the limitation of modern day schooling in challenging existing inequalities within society.

Teaching Methodology:
-------------------------------
>Teaching Methodology: The course will blend both synchronous and asynchronous teaching. Online classes will use a mixture of lectures, and group discussions.

In this course, we will survey certain key approaches and debates in the sociology of religion and engage with some of the central concerns of contemporary scholarship in the field. With its particular focus on South Asia and specifically Pakistan, this course also seeks to offer tools for understanding and analyzing contemporary developments in the religious sphere and their impact on politics and society.

HSS,SOC,243,Politics of Class and Markets,"This course aims to explore the relationship between states, markets, and classes, examining how social and economic forces shape politics in contemporary capitalist societies. The first section of the course focuses on the work of Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Polanyi, Simmel as a starting point for understanding the massive, inter-linked transformation of economic and political institutions and social relations with the shift towards capitalism. These introductory sessions are followed by critiques of the behavioral foundations of mainstream economics, before moving to a more detailed analysis of class. This second part of the course looks at contemporary debates on class and class structure, drawing on Marxist and Weberian debates on the subject, before exploring how class shapes democratic competition and legitimacy, political parties, and policy-making. The third section of the course delves into the ‘Varieties of Capitalism’ debate, focusing on the political and historical processes that have given rise to diverse institutional arrangements governing the regulation of the economy and the provision of welfare in contemporary capitalist societies. The course then concludes with sessions on globalization, post-industrialism, and the potential for realizing and implementing alternatives to capitalism.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,40,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,All undergraduate students,"Javed,Umair","Phase 2: First-year, sophomore and junior students in MGSHSS and SAHSOL

ANTH&SOC,SOC,322,Mobile Lives: Im/migration and Education,"""The world is experiencing an unprecedented era of human mobility across, and within, borders. With this mass movement of migrants and refugees, borders have become more – not less – relevant with increasing globalization. Managing migrant populations and providing basic social and educational services have become pressing concerns in all regions of the world. The study of ‘Immigration and Education’ presents a very interesting and rich contradiction. Institutionalized systems of education are tied to the interests of the nation state, and yet at the same time are spaces and places essentially characterized by the coming together of people and are symbols of individual and collective aspiration and agency.

This course will provide a broad introduction to theoretical and empirical perspectives that examine the role played by schooling in immigrant incorporation or exclusion, using cases from around the world thematically divided along the lines of South-North, North-North and South-South immigration. We will look at how governments manage increasing diversity and how immigrants strategize to maximize their educational investments. 

Questions that we will address will include how immigrant youth adapt to their new school environments, how the structure and practices of schools influence the student’s engagement with their new surroundings; differences in experiences of first and second-generation youth; the role of gender and immigrant educational experience; notions of citizenship and cosmopolitanism. 

This course primarily uses texts from the fields of sociology, anthropology and geography and thus is highly recommended to those enrolled in social sciences majors. The course is designed to emulate a student-led discussion seminar and as such doing the readings before every class is imperative.""

ANTH&SOC,SOC,342,"Culture, Power and Society","“Yeh hamara culture nahin hai” (This is not our culture). In most usage, this oft repeated statement is attempting to achieve two ends. First, it is engaged in an attempt to define ‘culture’ in a particular way. Second this particular definition is being used to exert influence and authority; it is designed to render certain objects, actions, thoughts, and attitudes as appropriate while dismissing others as impermissible. In other words, this act of defining culture is also an act of power. By exploring different cases of the power of culture, this course examines the various ways in which power is embedded in defining and practicing culture. It will shed light on the workings of power in and through the cultural dimensions of social life.
Following ongoing developments in the social sciences, such as the ‘cultural turn’ and post-structuralism, we will survey critical approaches to theorizing the concepts of ‘culture’ and power’ and investigate a variety of social contexts in which they inform each other. The goal is to move beyond limited definitions of culture as art and tradition as well as challenge the dominant view of power as the ability to use force. Thinking through these concepts and exploring the connections between them will bring alternative ways of understanding society into view. We will do so by surveying a variety of topics including culture as ideology and domination, subcultures and resistance, cultures of democracy, and cultural facets of nation-formation, consumption, and globalisation. We will also survey the importance of power and culture in the social construction of inequalities, identities, and emotions.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,40,0,Yes,No,2,100,No,Not Allowed,"Jaffer,Amen","Phase 2: Open for Sophomores, juniors and seniors MGSHSS and SAHSOL

ANTH&SOC,SOC,345,"Crime, Justice, and Society","This course invites participants to dive into thinking of crime and ideas of justice outside of the conventional, often sensationalist, lens. To do this, the course explores core concepts of Criminology and Penology and theories of law, and then asks what a Criminology for South Asia can look like. Arguably, Criminology is an older phenomenon in South Asia than in other parts of the world, tied to criminalising specific identities, the formulation of the Penal Code and design of prisons in South Asia. Therefore, participants will think critically and structurally about causes of crime (both individualised and collective/social), institutional responses (courts and prisons), and a context for understanding structural complexities, ideas and approaches to the very subjective idea of justice, thereby challenging conventional myths. 
 To do this, the course is designed to step out of conventional, often simplistic understanding of crime and the role of courts and prisons. This is done via a multidisciplinary approach, consisting of theoretical explanations from around the world. The course is therefore divided into three parts, each exploring theories on crime, prisons and the symbol and site of courts.  
 This is a reading and writing focused course. Students will be expected to participate in class and write a research paper at the end of the course.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,10,0,Yes,No,2,100,No,Not Allowed,"Akbar,Hiba","Phase 2: Open for all MGHSS sophomore, juniors and seniors

ANTH&SOC,SOC,364,Masculinities,"This course provides students with an introduction to the burgeoning field of masculinity studies—an area that has, until recently, received little attention in gender studies as a whole and in South Asia in particular. The course will assume a basic knowledge of gender studies. Students should have taken at least one GSS core or elective course as a prerequisite. The course will provide an overview of theories related to the social construction of masculinity. The course will then look at masculinities as they intersect with other forms of social stratification including race, ethnicity and class. Finally, as much of the literature on masculinities is focused on Europe and North America, the final third of the course will explore the role of masculinity in South Asian political and religious violence including analysing the Shiv Sena in India and the MQM and Islamism in Pakistan. It will also explore non-violent manifestations of South Asian masculinities, particularly as they relate to education and migration. At the end of the course, we will reflect upon the possibility of creating alternate forms of masculinity to imagine a different kind of future.",4.00,LEC,16W,S1,30,0,Yes,No,2,100,Yes,Not Allowed,"Kirmani,Nida Yasmeen","Phase 2: Open for MGSHSS and SAHSOL sophomores juniors and seniors

HSS,SS,100,Writing and Communication,"SS 100 is a four-credit undergraduate course designed for first year BA/BSc students at Lahore University of Management Sciences. It also accommodates students who may not have taken the course during their first year. Writing at the university level can seem like a daunting experience, so this introductory course is designed to develop students’ composition writing skills as well as their oral communication abilities – both essential to successful future university coursework. To address the first aim, we will spend the bulk of course time honing writing skills to create clear forceful prose, to formulate and support a compelling thesis, to employ rhetorical strategies effectively, and when appropriate, to observe the conventions of academic writing. To address the second aim, the course concurrently aims at developing a constructive and practical approach to effective oral communication in academic settings. Specific goals for this course include: gaining a clear sense of audience and purpose in persuasive writing and oral presentation; understanding and employing techniques of argument analysis; being awareness of style and voice; developing fluency in various aspects of the writing process, such as pre-writing, thesis development, evidence construction, critical analysis, revision techniques, and also working cooperatively with others on the final presentation project. Assignments are designed to support both course aims. Throughout the quarter students will have daily reading assignments that are meant to accompany the lecture material and they will be responsible for this material. They will write four essays, in addition to smaller written assignments and quizzes during the quarter.

Its  overriding  aim  is  to  introduce  the  student  to  the  academic  study  of  Islam—Islam  here  denoting  both  a  religious  system,  grounded  upon certain normative  revealed  sources,  as  well  as  a  civilization  unfolding  over  time  as  a  complex  network  of  cultures  shaped  by  historical  contingencies.    
In  other  words,  it  may  be  called  as  the  study  of  the  Islamic  Religious  Tradition. The  course  remains  indifferent  to  the  personal  beliefs  of  the  students, to any  sectarian  identity  they  espouse,  and  any  doctrinal  point  of  view  they  hold.  
The  course  also  does  not  take  any  sides.  It aims  to  report,  as  much  as  possible,  what  has  been  discussed  within  the  Islamic  religious  tradition. We shall begin by contextualizing this  course  by  looking  at  the  traditions of  learning  and transmission  of  knowledge  in  Muslims  societies,  enabling  students  to  understand  the  rationale and  function  of  this  course  at  LUMS  in  a  better  way.  From  there  we  move  to  the  fundamental methodological  question:  How  does  one  study  a  given  religious  system?  What  are  the  scholarly  tools  and  conceptual  frameworks  for  exploring  a  civilization  radiating  from a religious  core?  What  are  the  limitations  of  an  academic  study  of  Islam?  In  what  way  is  it  different  from  the  account  and  conception  of  the  believer  or,  in  the  case  of  cultures,  of  the  actor?
In  short,  how  do  we  approach  the  study  of  Islamic  religious  tradition  in  the  modern  
World in  a  university ?
From  here  we  move  on  to an  historical  overview  of  the  tradition.  We  look  at  the  ‘doctrinal aspects  including  the  Qur’an,  Hadith,  and  the  life  of  the  Prophet  (PBUH).  We  move  to  the  ‘intellectual’  aspects  exploring  the legal/jurisprudential,  theological  and  philosophical developments  and  discussions  in  the  Muslim  experience.

HSS,SS,388,Rethinking Data: Cause and Effect in the Humanities,"Do Harvard graduates earn more because of their degree or because of their family backgrounds? Cause-effect relationships are crucial in many areas of social science. Unfortunately, these relationships are not always directly implied in the data we encounter. This course helps humanities students understand how social scientists uncover these relationships in data using clever techniques. We do this by applying statistical principles in numerous real-world examples from diverse social science fields such as political science, history, psychology, and economics. Using these examples, we will show how researchers address important questions in policy and research situations.

The course begins by reviewing basic statistical techniques, like regression analysis. Then, we'll delve into the fundamentals of experimental design, covering topics like randomized controlled trials (RCTs), natural experiments, and quasi experiments. In the last part of the course, we'll explore the challenges of assessing how precise our estimates are and how that impacts our overall conclusions. 

The ability to connect cause and effect is highly valued in applied research, public policy, data science, and the technology industry. As a humanities major, this course will also equip you with the tools to understand and engage with data analyses found in research papers and policy reports.

BUSADM,TME,6101,Tech-Entrepreneurship,"Technology Entrepreneurship has created a never ending wave of technology revolution over the last three decades, and is now taken up as a driving force for economic revolution and growth. Different business models evolved due to technological advancement and new models entirely disrupted the existing markets. We have seen nations transforming through leveraging technology innovations. New economic superpowers emerging, who have been able to ride the wave of technology. So what is technology? What is Innovation? What is entrepreneurship? All these questions will be answered during this course of Technology Entrepreneurship. The course will focus on emerging possibilities in the field of technology, economic demand, problem analysis, developing innovative solutions and inspiring future leaders who can jump ship and make their ideas a reality. The course will emphasize on how to develop innovative ventures with scalable business models that can enable or accelerate economic change throughout Pakistan and transcending across boundaries. This course will use multiple examples / cases for discussion on how entrepreneurs brought the change and disrupted markets through innovation in technology and business models. This course on technology entrepreneurship is designed to provide a theoretical and an experiential introduction to the many dimensions of conceiving, starting and growing a technology venture. It will make students learn the essential concepts and frameworks of entrepreneurship and how they can be applied in the context of a technology start-up with the aid of local and international case studies, class discussions and project assignments. 

There is also a substantial opportunity for students to learn about the local entrepreneurship eco-system of Pakistan in the form of their interaction with local technology entrepreneurs at different stages of the course. It will give students an opportunity to get their technology ideas assessed and criticized by industry experts. This course is particularly suited for students wanting to start a technology startup but seeking to learn the process and theory behind achieving his/her ambitions. Furthermore, the design of the course is such that it will enable students to work extensively and collaboratively with their peers, and hence will give them a great opportunity to find their future co-founders. It is important to note that, at a broader level, this course will approach entrepreneurship as a mindset and behaviour to undertake value-creating and high-growth business initiatives in situations that warrants ‘tolerance for risk’ and ‘learning by doing’. It is for this reason that although the main focus of this course remains on preparing students to launch new technology start-ups, many of the concepts can easily apply in other scenarios as well, such as launching of new ventures within larger organizations.  

As for the structure of the course, it is divided into six sequential modules focusing on both soft and hard entrepreneurial skills. The discussion in Module 1 sets out to understand the cognitive part of the entrepreneurship process, i.e. the very logic of how entrepreneurs usually make decisions and the characteristics of an entrepreneurial DNA when compared to the managerial mindset. The same module will define the contours of technology entrepreneurship as they differ from traditional entrepreneurship and set a global perspective on the role of technology-driven ventures in different parts of the world. Module 2 will teach students a framework for identifying and assessing high-growth business opportunities and how to conceive an innovative and  scalable solutions to address those opportunities. This module will end at idea pitch presentations that will judged by a panel of external judges. Module 3 is exclusively designed to develop an understanding of the local landscape of technology entrepreneurship in Pakistan and the gaps that are yet to be filled therein, which will help students to frame relevant business ideas. All along Module 2 & 3, students will get out of building and engage in customer discovery interviews using the principles of design thinking in order to identify customer pain points and seek feedback on their proposed ideas to solve those pain points. In Module 4, students will learn about the concept of business model and its building blocks. Subsequently, they will use these conceptualizations in conjunction with a contemporary tool called ‘Business Model Canvas’ to transform their proposed business ideas from Module 2 & 3 into a complete business model. Module 5 will teach students about the fundamental principles of the Lean Startup Method, a widely used framework for launching technology ventures, in particular. The last module of the course will  give a flavor of miscellaneous topics related to technology startups, including legal aspects of technology entrepreneurship, fund raising and issues related to the decision of equity split amongst co-founders.",3.00,LEC,MS2,S1,30,0,Yes,No,3,120,Yes,Not Allowed,"Shahid,Muhammad Shehryar",

Keeping that in mind, proposal venture proposal writing course is designed to teach students how to write a winning proposal. Winning proposals are persuasive and interesting, but easy to read. They demonstrate clear objectives, specific time frames, reasonable budget requests and doable deliverables. This course will help students understand the concerns of potential funders and try to address those concerns in their proposals. Throughout the course experienced industry practitioners and entrepreneurs will be included in the course who will bring along the experience of working as money seekers and money donors, which makes them pros in both areas. This helps in giving participants a greater perspective of what potential funders and proposal evaluators are looking for when they read proposals. An ideal partnership occurs when one party has the ideas and the capacity to do a particular work, while the other party has the money to spend but not the other resources necessary to complete the work.

But did it ever occur to you to ask, “Who makes these complex technologies and systems happen?” This course is designed to develop student’s interest in the “behind-the-scenes” aspects of technology management. It is expected through this course that the students will begin to see the many innovations society is currently enjoying as the result of thousands of successful information technology projects. In this course, students will study the IT projects in organizations around the world that went well, similar as the National University Hospital in Singapore, which used critical chain scheduling to decrease patient admission times by more than 50 percent; retailer Zulily, one of a growing number of organizations developing software in-house to meet their need for speed and innovation; Dell’s green computing project that saves energy and millions of dollars; Google’s driverless car project, striving to reduce traffic accidents and save lives; and many more. Of course, not all technological projects are successful. Factors such as time, money, and unrealistic expectations, among many others, can sabotage a promising effort if it is not properly managed. Hence, the students, through this course, will learn from the mistakes made on many technology projects that were not successful as well. Practical demonstrations and industrial perspective in this course will enable the students to make rigorous decision making while keeping the success factors in mind. Several case studies and industrial visits will open many horizons for the students to realize the operations culture of technology-intense industries with a focus on software development and implication projects.  

The course explores contemporary technology and operations management problems through a number of cases and exercises. Microsoft Excel and PALISADE Suite (Precision Tree and @RISK) is used as a decision making tool through simulation modelling. Note that throughout the course and in the exam, we will be using Windows PC on desktop computers (Apple users need to work by themselves to adapt to the Windows PC environment).
